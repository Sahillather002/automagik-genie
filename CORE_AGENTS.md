# Core Agents
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`

Core Genie agents available globally (not tied to a specific collective):

- Forge — Orchestrates execution using domain Forge workflows (thin agent)
- Wish — Global wish orchestrator (delegates to domain-specific wish flows)
- Review — Global review orchestrator (delegates to domain-specific review flows)

Guiding principle: Keep core agents thin and delegate into collective workflows for domain specifics.
