# Events

> Understand real-time communication events exchanged between client and server in ElevenLabs Agents

## Overview

Events are the foundation of real-time communication in ElevenLabs Agents applications using WebSockets.
They facilitate the exchange of information like audio streams, transcriptions, agent responses, and contextual updates between the client application and the server infrastructure.

Understanding these events is crucial for building responsive and interactive conversational experiences.

Events are broken down into two categories:

    Events sent from the server to the client, delivering audio, transcripts, agent messages, and
    system signals.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Client-to-Server Events" href="/agents-platform/customization/events/client-to-server-events" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Events sent from the client to the server, providing contextual updates or responding to server
    requests.
