# Interrupt Handling

Based on AG-UI documentation for interrupt-aware run lifecycle.

## Interrupt-Aware Run Lifecycle Overview

### Core Concept
An interrupt is a mechanism that allows an agent to pause execution and request human input or approval before continuing. The system provides a standardized way to handle these interruptions across different agent frameworks.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Interrupt Mechanism
- Agents can send a "RUN_FINISHED" event with an "interrupt" outcome
- Interrupts include:
  - Optional interrupt ID
  - Reason for interruption
  - Payload with context or required information

### 2. Resume Process
Clients can resume an interrupted run by:
- Using the same thread ID
- Providing the original interrupt ID
- Sending a payload with user's response or additional information

## Example Interrupt Workflow
```
Agent → Client: Interrupt with proposal/context
Client → Agent: User approval/response
Agent → Client: Continue execution with new context
```

## Key Use Cases
- Human approval for sensitive actions
- Gathering additional user information
- Policy enforcement
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Error recovery scenarios

## Technical Specifications
- Supports arbitrary JSON payloads
- Provides flexible interrupt reasons
- Maintains state consistency across interruptions

## Implementation Considerations
- SDK updates for interrupt handling
- Framework integration support
- UI components for interrupt management
- Comprehensive testing strategies

## Relevance to Automagik Hello
For real-time voice agents:
- **Barge-in handling**: Interrupt TTS when user starts speaking
- **Clarification requests**: Pause when ASR confidence is low
- **Policy enforcement**: Stop for sensitive content detection
- **Error recovery**: Interrupt on STT/TTS failures
- **Human escalation**: Transfer to human agent when needed
- **Strategy switching**: Pause to change conversation strategies

The interrupt system could be adapted for voice-specific scenarios like managing speech overlap, handling audio quality issues, or implementing sophisticated turn-taking policies.
