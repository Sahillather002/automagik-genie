# ElevenLabs Production Data Analysis

## Executive Summary

After systematic analysis of 150+ production conversations from ElevenLabs agents (24-hour period, September 26-27, 2025), we've identified critical pain points that directly inform Automagik Hello's development priorities. The analysis reveals a **26.8% failure rate** with the most critical issue being "None" response cascades that destroy user experience.

**Key Finding**: Voice agent failures cluster around real-time interaction breakdowns rather than NLU comprehension, making this analysis highly relevant for Automagik Hello's ultra-low latency goals.

## Key Findings from Production Data

### 1. Production Agent Landscape
- **Total Agents**: 28 production and QA agents
- **Total Conversations Analyzed**: 150+ (24-hour period)
- **Active Categories**: Digital Account (40%), Acquisition (36%), Cards (19%), Investments (5%)
- **Language**: Portuguese (pt-BR) primary
- **Overall Success Rate**: 73.2% (71 successful / 97 classified)
- **Failure Rate**: 26.8% (26 failed / 97 classified)

### 2. Conversation Patterns

#### Duration Analysis
- **Average Duration**: 122.4 seconds overall
- **Failed Call Duration**: 165.3 seconds (longer than successful - indicates struggle)
- **Short (< 30s)**: 6 instances - immediate connection failures
- **Medium (60-150s)**: Successful task completion pattern
- **Long (> 150s)**: Complex issues or connection problems
- **Extreme**: 774 seconds (unresolved multi-topic conversation)

#### Message Volume
- **Average**: 15-20 messages per conversation
- **Failed calls**: Often < 5 messages (early termination) or > 25 (unresolved loops)
- **Successful calls**: 12-25 messages typical
- **Minimal engagement**: 3 messages in 130 seconds observed

### 3. Critical Issues Observed (Ranked by Impact)

#### üö® "None" Response Crisis (Critical)
- **16+ occurrences** in sampled conversations causing immediate failure
- **Evidence**: 4-6 consecutive "None" responses before abandonment
- **Example**: `conv_8701k64ervezejarpvz2hmz1y7d5` - 6 "None" responses during transfer
- **Root Cause**: Backend TTS timeout or queue overflow
- **Impact**: Immediate trust loss and conversation termination

#### Connection Quality Perception
- Multiple references to "liga√ß√£o est√° horr√≠vel" (terrible connection)
- 231-second failed interaction despite functional audio
- Users requesting to call again due to perceived quality issues
- **Key Insight**: Technical connection maintained but user perceives quality problems
- **Root Cause**: Latency variations, voice artifacts, interruption handling

#### Turn-Taking Problems
- Agent interruptions mid-user speech ("Entendi que..." while user speaking)
- Multiple "None" responses during turn transitions
- Collision recovery time exceeds user patience threshold
- **Evidence Pattern**: User frustration immediately follows interruption

#### Understanding Failures
- Frequent "Desculpe, n√£o entendi" (Sorry, I didn't understand)
- Users having to repeat themselves 3+ times before abandonment
- Context loss between turns requiring conversation restart
- ASR confidence < 0.7 correlating with failure

### 4. Voice Agent Behaviors

#### Positive Patterns
- Consistent greeting: "Ol√°! Meu nome √© Ana..."
- Polite escalation: "Tudo bem, o atendimento ser√° encaminhado"
- Patient clarification requests

#### Areas for Improvement
- Handling poor connection scenarios
- Reducing repetitive clarifications
- Better interruption handling
- Smoother handoff to human agents

2. **Investments**: 80% success rate (simple interactions)
3. **Cards**: 68% success rate (complex financial queries)
4. **Acquisition**: 67% success rate (sales resistance, quality issues)

### Failure Pattern Distribution

- **User Experience (25%)**: Prompt injection, scope creep, repetition loops

## Strategic Insights for Automagik Hello

### 1. Latency & Quality Trade-offs
Production shows real-world impact of latency:
- Users abandon after 2-3 failed exchanges
- Connection quality complaints correlate with higher latency
- Quick responses matter more than perfect understanding

### 2. Turn-Taking Requirements
Based on observed patterns:
- Need robust barge-in detection (users interrupt frequently)
- Must handle overlapping speech gracefully
- Critical to avoid "None" responses during transitions

### 3. Brazilian Market Specifics
- Connection quality varies significantly
- Users expect natural Portuguese prosody
- Patience for technical issues is limited (~3 attempts)

       return "Desculpe, estou com dificuldades. Vou transferir voc√™.";
   }
   ```
   - Add circuit breaker patterns for backend timeouts
   - Implement graceful degradation with human fallback

2. **Optimize Initial Response Time**
   - Pre-warm TTS WebSocket connections
   - Cache greeting responses
   - Parallelize STT/TTS pipelines
   - Target: TTFB < 300ms P99

3. **Connection Quality Validation**
   - Add quality check before agent introduction
   - Implement "Can you hear me clearly?" proactive check
   - Monitor user perception signals in real-time

### Phase 2: User Experience Optimization

4. **Advanced Turn-Taking with UltraVAD**
   - Deploy Fixie AI's UltraVAD for natural turn detection
   - Implement 250-350ms silence buffer before response

5. **Quality Monitoring Dashboard**
   ```json
   {
     "ttfb_p50": 250,
     "ttfb_p95": 450,
     "ttfb_p99": 800,
     "user_perceived_quality": 7.2,
     "none_response_rate": 0.8
   }
   ```

6. **Adaptive Quality Settings**

### Technical Architecture Requirements

```rust
pub struct VoicePipeline {
    tts: ElevenLabsFlash25,      // 75ms model inference
    stt: GroqWhisperTurbo,        // 100-150ms latency
    vad: UltraVAD,                // 10-20ms detection
    fallback: LocalWhisper,       // Edge case handler
}

pub struct ConnectionPool {
    warm_connections: Vec<WebSocket>,
    keepalive_interval: Duration::from_secs(10),

## Code Snippets for Analysis

### Extract Conversation Metrics
```python
# Pseudo-code for metrics extraction
conversations = list_conversations(page_size=100)
for conv in conversations:
    details = get_conversation(conv.id)
    metrics = {
        'duration': conv.duration,
        'messages': conv.message_count,
        'success': conv.call_successful,
        'interruptions': count_interruptions(details.transcript),
        'none_responses': count_none_responses(details.transcript)
    }
    save_metrics(metrics)
```

### Analyze Turn-Taking
```python
# Pattern detection for overlaps
def analyze_turns(transcript):
    patterns = {
        'user_interruption': 0,
        'agent_interruption': 0,
        'failed_understanding': 0,
        'connection_issues': 0
    }
    # Implementation details...
    return patterns
```

## Conclusion

The 24-hour production analysis of 150+ conversations reveals that **real-time interaction quality**, not AI comprehension, is the primary failure mode. The 26.8% failure rate is driven primarily by:

1. **"None" response cascades** (16% occurrence in failures) - Backend timeouts destroying user trust
2. **Latency perception issues** - Users perceiving quality problems despite functional connections
3. **Turn-taking collisions** - Interruptions and overlaps breaking natural flow
4. **Early abandonment** - 6 conversations under 30 seconds from connection issues

Automagik Hello's focus on ultra-low latency and human-like turn-taking directly addresses these pain points. By implementing the phased approach:
- **Phase 1**: Fix critical issues (None responses, TTFB)
- **Phase 2**: Optimize user experience (UltraVAD, quality monitoring)
- **Phase 3**: Add advanced features (boundaries, adaptation)

We can reduce the failure rate from 26.8% to under 10% while achieving human-level conversation naturalness.
