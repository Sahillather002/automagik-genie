# Project Overrides: Learn Agent

- **Primary Focus:** Document any repo-specific guardrails, evidence expectations, or command shortcuts the learn agent must apply when recording behavioural updates.
- **Reference Materials:** Point to local standards, onboarding guides, or domain-specific docs that every learning entry should cite.
- **Validation Hooks:** Note scripts or commands (e.g., `pnpm lint`, `cargo fmt --check`) that prove the correction works in this project.
- **Evidence Capture:** Specify preferred storage paths for screenshots, logs, or test outputs so Done Reports remain consistent.

Keep this file concise; reference existing docs with `@` instead of duplicating long sections. If no overrides are required, leave a single bullet explaining that the defaults from `@.genie/agents/core/learn.md` apply as-is.
