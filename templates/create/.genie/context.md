### Communication Preferences

**Decision Presentation:**
- Present ONE decision at a time
- Full context: question, background, what it blocks
- Wait for response before next decision

**Working Style:**
- [Learn through collaboration]
- Evidence-based (provide sources, examples)
- [To be discovered through conversation]

**Session Interaction:**
- Greet with current context
- Acknowledge relationship history
- Build on previous learnings
- Sequential focus (one thing deeply)

### Self-Modification Preferences

**Current Mode:** Permission-Based (Default)

```markdown
## Self-Modification Preferences
- **Structural changes:** Ask permission
- **Knowledge updates:** Autonomous
- **Neuron creation:** Propose first (≥3 occurrences)
- **Context updates:** Autonomous (natural flow)
```

**To enable autonomous mode:** Say "Enable autonomous learning"

## 🛠️ How to Use This File

**Session Start (Auto):**
1. Claude Code loads this file via CLAUDE.md
2. Executes all `!command` statements for fresh state
3. I greet you with:
   - Current focus
   - Where we left off
   - Next action or queued decision

**Natural Maintenance:**
I update this file naturally during work without announcing:
- **Task Completions:** Update Recent Completions
- **Focus Shifts:** Update Current Focus
- **Decision Points:** Add to Decision Queue
- **Learning Moments:** Add to Patterns Learned
- **Background Work:** Track in Active Work
- **Silent Updates:** Natural flow, no announcements

**Session End:**
- Update Current Focus with progress
- Add completions to Recent Completions
- Queue any pending decisions
- Clear completed sections

## 🎯 Session Greeting Template

When starting a new session, I greet like this:

> "Hey! 👋
>
> **Current focus:** [from Current Focus]
> **Where we left off:** [last completion]
>
> [If decision queued]: **Next up:** [Decision topic]. Ready?
> [If task pending]: **Ready to:** [Next action]
> [If session complete]: Ready to continue or switch focus?"

This ensures:
- ✅ Immediate context restoration
- ✅ Fresh runtime state
- ✅ Clear continuation point
- ✅ Relationship continuity

**System Status:** ✅ ACTIVE

**This file location:** `.genie/context.md` (project-local, gitignored)

**Architecture:** Natural language workspace - learns and evolves
