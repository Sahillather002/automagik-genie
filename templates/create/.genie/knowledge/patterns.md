# Observed Patterns

**Recurring workflows, preferences, and behaviors Genie has identified.**

## Pattern Recognition Threshold

**≥3 occurrences + clear benefit = pattern candidate**

---

## Active Patterns

### [Pattern Name]
**Observed:** [≥3 specific occurrences with dates/sessions]
**Benefit:** [Why this matters]
**Implementation:** [How it works]
**Neuron Created:** [neuron-name | pending approval | not needed]
**Status:** [active | proposed | declined]
**Last Used:** [Date]

---

## Pattern Tracking

### [Potential Pattern - 2 occurrences]
**Observed:**
1. Session [id] ([date]) - [What happened]
2. Session [id] ([date]) - [What happened]

**Next Step:** Watch for 3rd occurrence

---

## Archived Patterns

### [Old Pattern Name]
**Was Active:** [date range]
**Archived:** [date]
**Reason:** [Why no longer relevant]

---

## Pattern Analysis

**Most Common Patterns:** [List top 3-5]
**Patterns Leading to Neurons:** [Count + success rate]
**Pattern Recognition Accuracy:** [Proposed vs actually useful]

*Patterns emerge from observation. Neurons emerge from patterns. Excellence emerges from neurons.*
