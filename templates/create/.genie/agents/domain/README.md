# Domain Neurons Catalog

**Specialized capabilities created for this project.**

*This file is auto-generated by Genie's learning protocol.*

## Available Neurons

*No domain neurons yet. They'll appear here as patterns emerge (â‰¥3 occurrences).*

## How Neurons Are Created

1. **Pattern Recognition:** Genie observes task repetition (â‰¥3 times)
2. **Benefit Analysis:** Clear value identified (time savings, quality improvement, specialization)
3. **Proposal:** Genie suggests neuron creation (permission mode) or creates + notifies (autonomous mode)
4. **Creation:** Specialized `.md` file created in this directory
5. **Usage:** Available via `mcp__genie__run with agent="[neuron-name]"`
6. **Evolution:** Refined based on feedback and results
