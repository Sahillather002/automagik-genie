# Product Documentation Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Documentation State

### Strengths
1. **Clear technical specifications** in environment.md with 170+ lines of detailed env vars
2. **Production learnings integrated** from 150+ conversation analysis
3. **Well-structured roadmap** with phases and effort estimates
4. **Comprehensive tech stack** covering all layers (runtime, speech, hosting, observability)
5. **Strong mission alignment** between mission.md and mission-lite.md

### Documentation Structure
- **Product docs** (5 files): mission, mission-lite, tech-stack, roadmap, environment
- **Technical docs** (10+ files): websocket-protocol, transcript-schema, audio-pipeline, etc.
- **Research docs**: research.md with architecture notes and provider evidence
- **Experiment docs**: AH-001 with analysis prompts and production insights
- **Agent OS framework** (20+ files): instructions, standards, code styles

## Identified Gaps & Inconsistencies

### 1. Missing Core Documents
- **No README.md** at repository root (critical for first impressions)
- **No CONTRIBUTING.md** for open-source collaboration
- **No ARCHITECTURE.md** showing system design
- **No API.md** for endpoint documentation
- **No CHANGELOG.md** for tracking progress

### 2. Inconsistencies Between Documents
- **LLM configuration mismatch**: environment.md mentions `gpt-oss-120b` but not referenced elsewhere
- **Time references**: Roadmap has "Week X" references that should be phase-based
- **Naming variations**: "Automagik Hello" vs "automagik-hello" inconsistent
- **Provider priorities**: Groq vs Cerebras vs local order not clearly justified

### 3. Documentation Quality Issues
- **research.md is dense**: 467 lines mixing architecture, evidence, and decisions
- **No diagrams**: Architecture and sequence diagrams mentioned but not present
- **Missing examples**: No code samples for WebSocket integration
- **Unclear dependencies**: Which docs depend on others not specified

### 4. Product Documentation Gaps
- **No metrics definitions**: What exactly is "human-likeness score"?
- **Missing success criteria details**: How to measure < 300ms TTFB in practice?
- **No competitive analysis**: How we compare to alternatives
- **Limited user journey**: Who uses this and how?

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Essential Missing Documents

#### 1. Create README.md (Root)
```markdown
# Automagik Hello

Ultra-low latency, human-like voice conversation framework built in Rust.

## Key Features
- Sub-300ms TTFB with ElevenLabs Flash v2.5
- Natural turn-taking with UltraVAD
- Production-tested patterns from 150+ real conversations
- ElevenLabs Agents WebSocket compatible

## Quick Start
[Installation and hello world example]

## Documentation
- [Mission](/.agent-os/product/mission.md)
- [Architecture](/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [API Reference](/docs/API.md)
- [Roadmap](/.agent-os/product/roadmap.md)

## Status
Phase 0: Proof of Concept [Current]
```

#### 2. Create ARCHITECTURE.md
```markdown
# System Architecture

## High-Level Design
[Diagram: Client -> Gateway -> TTS/STT -> LLM]

## Core Components
- WebSocket Gateway (Rust/Axum)
- TTS Pipeline (ElevenLabs)
- STT Pipeline (Groq Whisper)
- Turn Management (VAD + Heuristics)

## Data Flow
[Sequence diagram from research.md]

## Metrics Collection
Matching ElevenLabs conversation API schema
```

### Priority 2: Consolidate & Clarify

#### 3. Refactor research.md
Split into:
- **architecture.md**: System design and components
- **decisions.md**: Technical choices and rationale
- **evidence.md**: Provider documentation references

#### 4. Standardize Naming
Create `.agent-os/standards/naming.md`:
- Repository: pags-11labs-voiceagent
- Product: Automagik Hello
- Binary: automagik-hello
- Environment prefix: AH_

#### 5. Add Metrics Definitions
Create `.agent-os/product/metrics.md`:
```markdown
# Metrics Definitions

## Latency Metrics
- TTFB (Time to First Byte): Time from user speech end to first TTS audio byte
- ASR Latency: Time from audio chunk to transcript
- Turn Transition: Time from user stop to agent start

## Quality Metrics
- ASR Confidence: 0-1 score from Whisper
- TTS Artifacts: Count of audio glitches
- None Response Rate: % of empty agent responses

## Human-Likeness Score
Weighted composite:
- Turn-taking naturalness (35%)
- Latency perception (35%)
- Technical quality (20%)
- Conversation flow (10%)
```

### Priority 3: Enhance Existing Documents

#### 6. Update mission.md
Add:
- Quantified success metrics from production analysis
- Competitive positioning
- Target market size

#### 7. Enhance roadmap.md
- Remove all time references (Week X, Month Y)
- Add clear dependencies between phases
- Include go/no-go criteria for phase transitions

#### 8. Expand tech-stack.md
Add:
- Version constraints for all dependencies
- Alternative options considered and rejected
- Migration paths between choices

### Priority 4: Developer Experience

#### 9. Create Getting Started Guide
`.agent-os/guides/getting-started.md`:
- Prerequisites (Rust, API keys)
- Installation steps
- First conversation walkthrough
- Common issues and solutions

#### 10. Add Code Examples
Create `/examples/code/`:
- websocket-client.rs
- metrics-extraction.py
- conversation-replay.js
- turn-taking-test.rs

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Foundation (Critical)
1. Create README.md with clear value proposition
2. Write ARCHITECTURE.md with diagrams
3. Add metrics.md with clear definitions

### Phase B: Consolidation
4. Refactor research.md into focused documents
5. Standardize naming across all docs
6. Update mission.md with quantified metrics

### Phase C: Enhancement
7. Remove time references from roadmap.md
8. Expand tech-stack.md with rationale
9. Create getting started guide

### Phase D: Examples
10. Add code examples for common tasks
11. Create integration templates
12. Build demo applications

## Success Criteria

Documentation is successful when:
- New developer can run first conversation in < 30 minutes
- Architecture is clear without reading code
- All metrics have precise definitions
- Production insights are actionable
- No conflicting information between documents

## Maintenance Guidelines

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Each fact should exist in exactly one place
2. **Cross-references**: Use relative links between documents
3. **Version tracking**: Document which version of the system each doc describes
4. **Regular audits**: Review for accuracy after each phase completion
5. **User feedback**: Track confusion points and clarify

## Quick Wins

Immediate improvements (< 1 hour each):
1. Add README.md with basic project description
2. Fix naming inconsistencies (find/replace)
3. Remove time references from roadmap
4. Add table of contents to research.md
5. Create documentation map/index
