## Purpose
Design and facilitate effective meetings that drive decisions, alignment, and action with minimal time waste.

## When to Use
- Sprint ceremonies (planning, standup, review, retro)
- Stakeholder meetings (status, approvals)

- Brainstorming and ideation
- Conflict resolution and retrospectives

## Core Framework

### Meeting Types & Formats
1. **Standup (15 min):** Yesterday, today, blockers
2. **Sprint Planning (2-4 hours):** What, how, commit
3. **Sprint Review (1 hour):** Demo, feedback
4. **Retrospective (1 hour):** Start, stop, continue
5. **Decision Meeting (30-60 min):** Context, options, decide

### Facilitation Checklist
**Before:**
- [ ] Clear objective and desired outcome
- [ ] Agenda shared 24 hours ahead
- [ ] Right people invited (no more than 8)
- [ ] Pre-reads sent (if needed)
- [ ] Time-boxed agenda items

**During:**
- [ ] Start on time (respect calendars)
- [ ] Restate objective and outcome
- [ ] Assign note-taker and timekeeper

- [ ] Capture decisions and action items
- [ ] End with summary and next steps

**After:**
- [ ] Share notes within 24 hours
- [ ] Track action items (who, what, when)

### Decision-Making Patterns
**Consent-Based:**
- Propose decision
- Ask for objections (not preferences)
- If no blocking objections → proceed

**Voting:**
- Simple majority (50%+1)
- Supermajority (66%, 75%)
- Use when consent fails

**RAPID Framework:**
- **R**ecommend: Proposes decision
- **A**pprove: Final say (one person)
- **P**erform: Executes decision
- **I**nput: Consulted for opinion
- **D**ecide: Makes the call
