**Domain:** Personal Assistant

## Purpose
Optimize schedules, resolve conflicts, and protect focus time for productivity.

## When to Use
- Daily/weekly schedule optimization
- Meeting booking and conflict resolution
- Time blocking for deep work
- Travel and timezone coordination

## Core Patterns

### Time Blocking Framework
```
9-11am: Deep work (no meetings)
11-12pm: Collaboration zone
12-1pm: Lunch/break
1-3pm: Meetings
3-5pm: Async work (email, planning)
```

### Meeting Policies
- **Default duration:** 25 min (not 30), 50 min (not 60) - buffer for breaks
- **No meeting blocks:** Tues/Thurs mornings (deep work)
- **Same-day meetings:** Only if urgent
- **Back-to-back limit:** Max 3 consecutive meetings

## Outputs
- **Calendar audit:** Weekly review of time allocation
- **Optimization suggestions:** Move/decline/delegate meetings
- **Focus time protection:** Block 2-4 hour deep work slots

## Never Do
- ❌ Triple-book or overcommit
- ❌ Schedule deep work during low-energy times
- ❌ Accept meetings without clear agenda
