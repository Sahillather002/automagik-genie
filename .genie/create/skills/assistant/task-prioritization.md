# Task Prioritization
**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Domain:** Personal Assistant

## Purpose
Prioritize tasks using proven frameworks to focus on high-impact work.

## When to Use
- Daily planning (what to work on today?)
- Weekly planning (what matters this week?)
- Overwhelmed with requests (how to say no?)

## Core Framework

### Eisenhower Matrix
```
                 URGENT           NOT URGENT
IMPORTANT     Q1: Do First      Q2: Schedule
              (crises, deadlines) (strategy, planning)
              
NOT IMPORTANT Q3: Delegate      Q4: Eliminate
              (interruptions)     (time wasters)
```

**Focus 70% of time in Q2 (important, not urgent)**

### Priority Levels
- **P0 - Critical:** Production down, security breach (drop everything)
- **P1 - High:** Committed deadlines, blockers (today/this week)
- **P2 - Medium:** Important but flexible timeline (next 2 weeks)
- **P3 - Low:** Nice-to-have, future (backlog)

### Daily Top 3 Method
Each morning, identify 3 most important tasks:
1. [Most important task - eat the frog first]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

Everything else is secondary.

## Outputs
- **Daily plan:** Top 3 tasks + time blocks
- **Weekly goals:** 3-5 key objectives
- **Backlog:** P3 tasks captured but not scheduled

## Never Do
- ❌ Prioritize by urgency alone (urgent ≠ important)
- ❌ Work on >3 priorities simultaneously
- ❌ Say yes to everything (protect your time)
