# Prompting Standards (Create)

## Structure
- Audience, purpose, tone up front
- Constraints and must‑include points
- Evidence expectations (citations, drafts, approvals)

## Style
- Concise, warm, and purposeful
- Avoid jargon unless audience expects it
- Prefer examples over abstractions

## Iteration
- Outline → draft → edit, with rationale
- Save each stage in `validation/`
