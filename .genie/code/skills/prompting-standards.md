# Prompting Standards

**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Core principles:**
- Use Discovery → Implementation → Verification sections in agents and prompts.
- Always reference files with `@` to auto-load content.
- Define success/failure boundaries explicitly.
- Encourage concrete examples/snippets over abstractions.
- Advanced prompting guidance lives in `@.genie/code/agents/prompt.md`.

For @ / ! / Feature Reference, Task Breakdown Structure, Context Gathering Protocol, Blocker Report Protocol, Done Report Template, and CLI Command Interface, see:

**./.genie/agents/prompt/prompt.md** (Prompting standards section)
