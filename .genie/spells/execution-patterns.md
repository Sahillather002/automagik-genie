# Execution Patterns

**Evidence capture standards for repeatability and QA:**

## Evidence Checklist

- Command outputs for failures and fixes.
- Screenshots/logs for QA flows.
- Git diff reviews prior to human handoff.
- Metrics examples (customize per project): latency budgets, throughput, accuracy, quality.
