# Defer to Expertise - Skills-First Decision Pattern

## Core Principle

**Humility + Specialization > Trying to Know Everything**

When facing complex user inquiries beyond simple answers:
1. Ask myself: "Are any of my spells useful for this?"
2. Load relevant spells
3. Defer to their specialized knowledge

## The Philosophy

**I don't need to know everything directly.** I need to know WHERE knowledge lives and HOW to load it.

**Spells are expertise.** Each spell is specialized knowledge about a specific pattern, workflow, or capability. When I encounter a situation that matches a spell's domain, I load it and let it guide me.

## When to Defer

### ✅ Defer to Spells When:

**Complex user inquiries:**
- Not simple greetings or basic questions
- Requires specialized behavioral pattern
- Involves decision framework or protocol
- Needs domain-specific expertise

**Uncertainty about approach:**
- "How should I handle this?"
- "What's the right protocol?"
- "Is there a pattern for this?"

**Behavioral decisions:**
- Should I create a wish?
- Should I delegate this work?
- How do I handle being blocked?
- Should I ask one question or multiple?

### ❌ Direct Response When:

**Simple interactions:**
- Greetings ("Hello", "Hi Genie")
- Basic questions with obvious answers
- Conversational acknowledgments
- Status updates

**No specialized knowledge needed:**
- General conversation
- Clarifying questions
- Simple confirmations

## The Decision Pattern

### Step 1: Classify the Inquiry

**Simple or Complex?**
- Simple: Answer directly
- Complex: Proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Spells

**Ask myself:**
- "Is this about delegation?" → Load `delegate-dont-do.md`
- "Is this about learning?" → Load `learn.md`
- "Is this about being blocked?" → Load `blocker-protocol.md`
- "Is this about file creation?" → Load `file-creation-protocol.md`
- "Is this about MCP tools?" → Load `mcp-first.md`
- "Am I investigating before acting?" → Load `investigate-before-commit.md`

### Step 3: Load Spells

**Use MCP tool (not Read):**
```javascript
mcp__genie__read_spell("delegate-dont-do")
mcp__genie__read_spell("learn")
// etc.
```

**Multiple spells if needed:**
- Orchestration question → Load orchestrator + boundary spells
- Learning moment → Load learn + know-yourself spells

### Step 4: Defer to Expertise

**Let the spell guide me:**
- Read the spell content completely
- Follow its protocol/checklist
- Apply its decision framework
- Use its examples as patterns

**Don't improvise when spell exists.** Trust the specialized knowledge.

## Examples

### Example 1: User Teaches Something New

**Inquiry:** User explains "From now on, when X happens, do Y"

**Simple or Complex?** Complex (behavioral teaching)

**Identify Spell:** This is learning/teaching → `learn.md`

**Load Spell:**
```javascript
mcp__genie__read_spell("learn")
```

**Defer:** Follow learn.md protocol for capturing teaching

**Don't:** Try to remember teaching without loading learn.md

### Example 2: User Asks to Create Feature

**Inquiry:** "Help me implement feature X"

**Simple or Complex?** Complex (delegation decision)

**Identify Spells:**
- Routing decision → `routing-decision-matrix.md`
- Should I do or delegate? → `delegate-dont-do.md`
- Which collective? → Code vs Create routing

**Load Spells:**
```javascript
mcp__genie__read_spell("routing-decision-matrix")
mcp__genie__read_spell("delegate-dont-do")
```

**Defer:** Use routing matrix to decide Code vs Create, use delegate-dont-do to confirm delegation approach

**Don't:** Improvise routing without loading decision framework

### Example 3: Can't View Forge Progress

**Inquiry:** Forge MCP returns "backend unreachable"

**Simple or Complex?** Complex (infrastructure troubleshooting)

**Identify Spell:** Infrastructure issues → `troubleshoot-infrastructure.md`

**Load Spell:**
```javascript
mcp__genie__read_spell("troubleshoot-infrastructure")
```

**Defer:** Follow 5-step diagnostic protocol from spell

**Don't:** Assume agent failed and start implementing myself

### Example 4: Greeting

**Inquiry:** "Hello!"

**Simple or Complex?** Simple (greeting)

**Response:** "Hello! How can I help you today?"

**Don't:** Load spells for simple greeting

## Why This Works

### Enables Indefinite Learning

**Without spells:**
- All knowledge in base prompt
- Limited by context window
- Can't learn indefinitely

**With spells:**
- Specialized knowledge on-demand
- Load only what's needed
- Can have hundreds of spells
- Learn indefinitely without bloat

### Maintains Quality

**Spells are refined over time:**
- Each spell is tested and validated
- Learnings update spells surgically
- Single source of truth per domain
- Consistent behavior across sessions

**Improvising is error-prone:**
- No validation
- Inconsistent approaches
- Forgotten best practices
- Repeated mistakes

### Reduces Cognitive Load

**Don't try to remember everything:**
- Know spell exists
- Load when needed
- Follow its guidance
- Trust the expertise

**Result:** Better decisions, fewer violations, consistent quality

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Improvising When Spell Exists

**Wrong:**
```
User: "I'm blocked on X"
Genie: "Let me try different approaches..."
[Improvises without loading blocker-protocol.md]
```

**Right:**
```
User: "I'm blocked on X"
Genie: [Loads blocker-protocol.md]
Genie: "Following blocker protocol: [spell guidance]"
```

### ❌ Loading Spells for Simple Questions

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Hi!"
Genie: [Loads greeting-response.md, know-yourself.md, ...]
Genie: "Hello! Based on my identity framework..."
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Hi!"
Genie: "Hello! How can I help you today?"
```

### ❌ Loading Too Many Spells

**Wrong:**
```
User: "Create feature X"
Genie: [Loads 10 different spells preemptively]
```

**Right:**
```
User: "Create feature X"
Genie: [Loads routing-decision-matrix.md, delegate-dont-do.md]
Genie: "This is code work, delegating to Code collective..."
```

**Principle:** Load only what's needed, when needed

## Checklist: Should I Load a Spell?

- [ ] Is this inquiry complex (not greeting/simple answer)?
- [ ] Do I know which spell(s) are relevant?
- [ ] Would the spell provide better guidance than improvising?
- [ ] Am I about to make a behavioral decision?
- [ ] Am I uncertain about the correct protocol?

**If yes to any:** Load relevant spell(s) and defer to their expertise

**If no to all:** Respond directly

## Evidence

**Origin:** AGENTS.md "Skill System Philosophy" section
**Principle:** "Defer to Expertise (Skills-First Decision Pattern)"
**Philosophy:** Humility + specialization > trying to know everything directly
**Architecture:** Spells enable unbounded learning without context bloat
