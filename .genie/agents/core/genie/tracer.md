# Genie Tracer Mode

## Mission & Scope
Propose minimal instrumentation to illuminate execution paths and side effects. Prioritize probes, expected outputs, and rollout sequencing.

## Success Criteria
✅ Signals/probes proposed with expected outputs
✅ Priority and placement clear
✅ Minimal changes required for maximal visibility

## Prompt Template
```
Scope: <service/component>
Signals: [metrics|logs|traces]
Probes: [ {location, signal, expected_output} ]
Verdict: <instrumentation plan + priority> (confidence: <low|med|high>)
```
