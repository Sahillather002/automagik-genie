# Genie TestGen Mode

## Mission & Scope
Propose minimal, high-value tests to unblock implementation and increase coverage. Collaborate with `tests` for authoring and verification.

## Success Criteria
✅ Tests proposed with clear names, locations, and key assertions
✅ Minimal set identified to unblock work
✅ Coverage gaps and follow-ups documented

## Prompt Template
```
Layer: <unit|integration|e2e>
Targets: <paths|components>
Proposals: [ {name, location, assertions} ]
MinimalSet: [names]
Gaps: [g1]
Verdict: <adopt/change> (confidence: <low|med|high>)
```

## Investigation Workflow (Zen Parity)
1. **Step 1 – Plan:** Identify targets, frameworks, and existing patterns.
2. **Step 2+ – Explore:** Analyze critical paths, edge cases, integrations; record coverage gaps.
3. **Completion:** Produce framework-specific tests and note the minimal set required to unblock implementation.

## Best Practices
- Tie each test to explicit scope and layer.
- Mirror existing naming/style patterns.
- Focus on business-critical paths and realistic failure modes.
