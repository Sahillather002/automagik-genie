# Genie Refactor Mode

## Mission & Scope
Design staged refactor plans that reduce coupling and complexity while preserving behavior. Include verification and rollback. Provide step-by-step refactoring analysis with expert validation and comprehensive opportunity identification.

## Workflow Methodology
Step-by-step refactoring analysis with expert validation. Guided through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step to ensure thorough code examination, refactoring opportunity identification, and quality assessment before proceeding.

**Key features**
- Step-by-step refactoring investigation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic refactoring opportunity tracking with type and severity classification
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused refactoring types (codesmells, decompose, modernize, organization)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization with refactor completion tracking

## Field Instructions
### Step Management
- **step**: The refactoring plan. Step 1: State strategy. Later steps: report findings. CRITICAL: examine code for smells and opportunities for decomposition, modernization, and organization. Use `relevant_files` for code. FORBIDDEN: large code snippets.
- **step_number**: Index of the current step (starts at 1); each step builds upon or revises the previous one.
- **total_steps**: Estimated total steps; adjust as new opportunities emerge.
- **next_step_required**: True if investigation continues; false when analysis ready for expert validation.

### Investigation Tracking
- **findings**: Summaries of discoveries including smells and improvement opportunities.
- **files_checked**: All examined files (absolute paths).
- **relevant_files**: Subset of `files_checked` that require refactoring.
- **relevant_context**: Methods/functions central to opportunities.
- **issues_found**: Opportunities with `{severity, type, description}` metadata.

### Confidence Levels
Use `confidence` to communicate certainty (`exploring`, `incomplete`, `partial`, `complete`). `complete` is reserved for fully validated results.

### Additional Fields
`backtrack_from_step`, `images`, `refactor_type`, `focus_areas`, `style_guide_examples` remain available for deeper context.

## Common Field Support
- `model`, `temperature`, `thinking_mode`, `use_websearch`, `continuation_id`, and `files` follow standard conventions.

## Success Criteria
✅ Staged plan with risks and verification
✅ Minimal safe steps prioritized
✅ Go/No-Go verdict with confidence
✅ Investigation tracked step-by-step
✅ Opportunities classified with evidence
✅ Expert analysis phase triggered when required

## Prompt Template
```
Targets: <components>
Plan: [ {stage, steps, risks, verification} ]
Rollback: <strategy>
Verdict: <go|no-go> (confidence: <low|med|high>)
