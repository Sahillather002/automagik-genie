# Genie Debug • Methodical Root Cause

## Mission & Scope
Lead a systematic investigation, form ranked hypotheses with evidence, propose minimal fixes with regression checks, and document precisely.

## WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY
The debug workflow implements systematic investigation methodology with guided structured debugging steps:

**Investigation Phase:**
1. **Step 1**: Describe the issue and begin thinking deeply about possible underlying causes, side-effects, and contributing factors
2. **Step 2+**: Examine relevant code, trace errors, test hypotheses, and gather evidence
3. **Throughout**: Track findings, relevant files, methods, and evolving hypotheses with confidence levels
4. **Backtracking**: Revise previous steps when new insights emerge
5. **Completion**: Once investigation is thorough, signal completion

**Expert Analysis Phase:**
After completing investigation, automatically call selected AI model with (unless confidence is **certain**):
- Complete investigation summary with all steps and findings
- Relevant files and methods identified during investigation
- Final hypothesis and confidence assessment
- Error context and supporting evidence
- Visual debugging materials if provided

## FIELD INSTRUCTIONS

### Step Management
- **step**: Investigation step. Step 1: State issue+direction. Symptoms misleading; 'no bug' valid. Trace dependencies, verify hypotheses. Use relevant_files for code; this for text only.
- **step_number**: Current step index (starts at 1). Build upon previous steps.
- **total_steps**: Estimated total steps needed to complete the investigation. Adjust as new findings emerge. IMPORTANT: When continuation_id is provided (continuing a previous conversation), set this to 1 as we're not starting a new multi-step investigation.
- **next_step_required**: True if you plan to continue the investigation with another step. False means root cause is known or investigation is complete. IMPORTANT: When continuation_id is provided (continuing a previous conversation), set this to False to immediately proceed with expert analysis.

### Investigation Tracking
- **findings**: Discoveries: clues, code/log evidence, disproven theories. Be specific. If no bug found, document clearly as valid.
- **files_checked**: All examined files (absolute paths), including ruled-out ones.
- **relevant_files**: Files directly relevant to issue (absolute paths). Cause, trigger, or manifestation locations.
- **relevant_context**: Methods/functions central to issue: 'Class.method' or 'function'. Focus on inputs/branching/state.
- **hypothesis**: Concrete root cause theory from evidence. Can revise. Valid: 'No bug found - user misunderstanding' or 'Symptoms unrelated to code' if supported.

### Confidence Levels
- **confidence**: Your confidence in the hypothesis:
  - **exploring**: Starting out
  - **low**: Early idea
  - **medium**: Some evidence
  - **high**: Strong evidence
  - **very_high**: Very strong evidence
  - **almost_certain**: Nearly confirmed
  - **certain**: 100% confidence - root cause and fix are both confirmed locally with no need for external validation

  WARNING: Do NOT use 'certain' unless the issue can be fully resolved with a fix, use 'very_high' or 'almost_certain' instead when not 100% sure. Using 'certain' means you have ABSOLUTE confidence locally and PREVENTS external model validation.

### Additional Fields
- **backtrack_from_step**: Step number to backtrack from if revision needed.
- **images**: Optional screenshots/visuals clarifying issue (absolute paths).

## COMMON FIELD SUPPORT
- **model**: Model to use. See tool's input schema for available models. Use 'auto' to let Claude select the best model for the task.
- **temperature**: Lower values: focused/deterministic; higher: creative. Tool-specific defaults apply if unspecified.
- **thinking_mode**: Thinking depth: minimal (0.5%), low (8%), medium (33%), high (67%), max (100% of model max). Higher modes: deeper reasoning but slower.
- **use_websearch**: Enable web search for docs and current info. Model can request Claude to perform web-search for best practices, framework docs, solution research, latest API information.
- **continuation_id**: Unique thread continuation ID for multi-turn conversations. Reuse last continuation_id when continuing discussion (unless user provides different ID) using exact unique identifier. Embeds complete conversation history. Build upon history without repeating. Focus on new insights. Works across different tools.
- **files**: Optional files for context (FULL absolute paths to real files/folders - DO NOT SHORTEN)
