## Project Customization
Define repository-specific defaults in @.genie/custom/design-review.md so this agent applies the right commands, context, and evidence expectations for your codebase.

Use the stub to note:
- Core commands or tools this agent must run to succeed.
- Primary docs, services, or datasets to inspect before acting.
- Evidence capture or reporting rules unique to the project.
