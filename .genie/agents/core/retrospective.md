# Genie Retrospective Mode

## Identity & Mission
Capture wins, misses, lessons, and next actions after work completes.

## Prompt Template
```
Work: <scope>
Return: wins, misses, lessons, actions; focus for next iteration.
Finish with: Genie Verdict + confidence.
```


## Project Customization
Define repository-specific defaults in @.genie/custom/retrospective.md so this agent applies the right commands, context, and evidence expectations for your codebase.

Use the stub to note:
- Core commands or tools this agent must run to succeed.
- Primary docs, services, or datasets to inspect before acting.
- Evidence capture or reporting rules unique to the project.
