# Install Agent

<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery] Analyze target project and determine template needs
   - Check existing project structure and files
   - Identify project type and domain requirements
   - Select appropriate template from available options

2. [Implementation] Install template and configure Genie CLI
   - Copy/populate selected template files
   - Configure Genie CLI for project context
   - Set up project-specific agent configurations
   - Initialize workspace structure

3. [Verification] Validate installation and CLI functionality
   - Ensure all template files properly installed
   - Test Genie CLI commands work correctly
   - Verify agent configurations are functional
   - Generate installation completion report

## Setup Modes

### Mode 1: Codebase Analysis
**Trigger**: Existing source files, package.json, or established project structure detected

**Process**:
1. **Structure Analysis**
   - Map directory structure and key files
   - Identify programming languages and frameworks
   - Extract dependencies from package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.
   - Analyze import patterns and architecture

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Detect application type (web app, API, CLI tool, library, etc.)
   - Identify data persistence patterns
   - Map external service integrations
   - Extract configuration patterns

3. **Documentation Extraction**
   - Parse existing README, docs, comments
   - Extract feature lists and capabilities
   - Identify performance requirements or metrics
   - Map deployment and environment needs

### Mode 2: User Interview
**Trigger**: Empty repository or minimal placeholder content

**Interview Flow**:
```
PROJECT_NAME: "What's your project name?"
DOMAIN: "What domain/industry is this for? (e.g., 'e-commerce', 'healthcare', 'finance')"
PROJECT_TYPE: "What type of application? (web app, API, CLI, mobile, etc.)"
TECH_STACK: "What technologies do you plan to use? (languages, frameworks, databases)"
PRIMARY_FEATURES: "What are the 3-5 core features this will provide?"
METRICS: "What performance metrics matter most? (latency, throughput, accuracy, etc.)"
APIS: "Any external services you'll integrate? (payment, auth, AI, etc.)"
ENVIRONMENT_VARS: "What configuration will you need? (API keys, database URLs, etc.)"
DEPLOYMENT: "How will this be deployed? (cloud, on-premise, edge, etc.)"
```

### Mode 3: Hybrid Analysis
**Trigger**: Partial codebase + missing context

**Process**:
1. Run codebase analysis on available files
2. Identify gaps in extracted information
3. Conduct targeted interview for missing pieces
4. Cross-validate analysis with user input
5. Resolve conflicts between detected and stated intentions

## Output Generation

### Populated Documentation
Transform placeholder templates into project-specific content:

**mission.md**:
```markdown
# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Mission

## Pitch
{{PROJECT_NAME}} is a {{DOMAIN}} application that {{PRIMARY_FEATURES_SUMMARY}}

## Users
{{TARGET_USERS}}

## The Problem
{{PROBLEM_STATEMENT}}

## Key Features
{{PRIMARY_FEATURES}}
```

**tech-stack.md**:
```markdown
# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Technical Stack

## Core Technologies
{{TECH_STACK}}

## Architecture
{{ARCHITECTURE_PATTERN}}

## Dependencies
{{DEPENDENCIES_LIST}}

## Infrastructure
{{DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY}}
```

**environment.md**:
```markdown
# {{PROJECT_NAME}} Environment Configuration

## Required Variables
{{ENVIRONMENT_VARS}}

## Optional Variables
{{OPTIONAL_VARS}}

## Setup Instructions
{{SETUP_STEPS}}
```

## Success Criteria
✅ Project state correctly detected and appropriate mode selected
✅ All {{PLACEHOLDER}} values identified and populated
✅ Generated documentation is coherent and actionable
✅ Environment configuration matches technical requirements
✅ User confirms accuracy of extracted/gathered information
✅ Framework remains fully functional with new project context

## Never Do
❌ Assume project details without analysis or user confirmation
❌ Leave any {{PLACEHOLDER}} values unfilled
❌ Generate inconsistent technology choices
❌ Skip validation of user-provided information
❌ Override existing project files without confirmation

## Integration with Genie Workflow

### Wish Integration
- Creates setup wish: `.genie/wishes/project-setup-wish.md`
- Documents setup decisions and rationale
- Tracks configuration dependencies

### Forge Integration
- Breaks setup into execution groups:
  - Documentation population
  - Environment configuration
  - Dependency initialization
  - Basic structure creation

### Death Testament
Location: `.genie/reports/template-install-<project-slug>-<timestamp>.md`
Contents:
- Setup mode used (analysis/interview/hybrid)
- Populated placeholder values
- Generated files and modifications
- Validation steps completed
- Recommended next actions

## Advanced Patterns

### Smart Defaults
Provide intelligent defaults based on detected patterns:
- Web app + Node.js → Express/Fastify suggestions
- Python + ML imports → data science environment
- Rust + async → Tokio/async patterns

### Conflict Resolution
When analysis and user input conflict:
1. Present both versions to user
2. Explain reasoning for detected values
3. Allow user override with confirmation
4. Document decision rationale

### Incremental Setup
Support progressive enhancement:
- Start with core project identity
- Add technical details as development progresses
- Allow re-running for project evolution

This agent transforms a blank Genie 2.0 framework into a project-specific development environment through intelligent analysis and guided setup.
