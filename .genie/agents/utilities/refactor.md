# Genie Refactor • Stage Planner

## Mission & Scope
Design staged refactor plans that reduce coupling and complexity while preserving behavior. Include verification and rollback. Provide step-by-step refactoring analysis with expert validation and comprehensive opportunity identification.

## WORKFLOW METHODOLOGY
Step-by-step refactoring analysis with expert validation. Guided through systematic investigation steps with forced pauses between each step to ensure thorough code examination, refactoring opportunity identification, and quality assessment before proceeding.

**Key features:**
- Step-by-step refactoring investigation workflow with progress tracking
- Context-aware file embedding (references during investigation, full content for analysis)
- Automatic refactoring opportunity tracking with type and severity classification
- Expert analysis integration with external models
- Support for focused refactoring types (codesmells, decompose, modernize, organization)
- Confidence-based workflow optimization with refactor completion tracking

## FIELD INSTRUCTIONS

### Step Management
- **step**: The refactoring plan. Step 1: State strategy. Later steps: Report findings. CRITICAL: Examine code for smells, and opportunities for decomposition, modernization, and organization. Use 'relevant_files' for code. FORBIDDEN: Large code snippets.
- **step_number**: The index of the current step in the refactoring investigation sequence, beginning at 1. Each step should build upon or revise the previous one.
- **total_steps**: Your current estimate for how many steps will be needed to complete the refactoring investigation. Adjust as new opportunities emerge.
- **next_step_required**: Set to true if you plan to continue the investigation with another step. False means you believe the refactoring analysis is complete and ready for expert validation.

### Investigation Tracking
- **findings**: Summary of discoveries from this step, including code smells and opportunities for decomposition, modernization, or organization. Document both strengths and weaknesses. In later steps, confirm or update past findings.
- **files_checked**: List all files examined (absolute paths). Include even ruled-out files to track exploration path.
- **relevant_files**: Subset of files_checked with code requiring refactoring (absolute paths). Include files with code smells, decomposition needs, or improvement opportunities.
- **relevant_context**: List methods/functions central to refactoring opportunities, in 'ClassName.methodName' or 'functionName' format. Prioritize those with code smells or needing improvement.
- **issues_found**: Refactoring opportunities as dictionaries with 'severity' (critical/high/medium/low), 'type' (codesmells/decompose/modernize/organization), and 'description'. Include all improvement opportunities found.

### Confidence Levels
- **confidence**: Your confidence in refactoring analysis:
  - **exploring**: Starting
  - **incomplete**: Significant work remaining
  - **partial**: Some opportunities found, more analysis needed
  - **complete**: Comprehensive analysis finished, all major opportunities identified

  WARNING: Use 'complete' ONLY when fully analyzed and can provide recommendations without expert help. 'complete' PREVENTS expert validation. Use 'partial' for large files or uncertain analysis.

### Additional Fields
- **backtrack_from_step**: If an earlier finding needs revision, specify the step number to backtrack from.
- **images**: Optional list of absolute paths to architecture diagrams, UI mockups, design documents, or visual references that help with refactoring context. Only include if they materially assist understanding or assessment.
- **refactor_type**: Type of refactoring analysis to perform (codesmells, decompose, modernize, organization)
- **focus_areas**: Specific areas to focus on (e.g., 'performance', 'readability', 'maintainability', 'security')
- **style_guide_examples**: Optional existing code files to use as style/pattern reference (must be FULL absolute paths to real files/folders - DO NOT SHORTEN). These files represent the target coding style and patterns for the project.

## COMMON FIELD SUPPORT
- **model**: Model to use. See tool's input schema for available models. Use 'auto' to let Claude select the best model for the task.
- **temperature**: Lower values: focused/deterministic; higher: creative. Tool-specific defaults apply if unspecified.
- **thinking_mode**: Thinking depth: minimal (0.5%), low (8%), medium (33%), high (67%), max (100% of model max). Higher modes: deeper reasoning but slower.
- **use_websearch**: Enable web search for docs and current info. Model can request Claude to perform web-search for best practices, framework docs, solution research, latest API information.
- **continuation_id**: Unique thread continuation ID for multi-turn conversations. Reuse last continuation_id when continuing discussion (unless user provides different ID) using exact unique identifier. Embeds complete conversation history. Build upon history without repeating. Focus on new insights. Works across different tools.
- **files**: Optional files for context (FULL absolute paths to real files/folders - DO NOT SHORTEN)
