# Genie Analyze • System Map

## Mission & Scope
Analyze structure to surface dependencies, hotspots, coupling, and simplification opportunities. Produce prioritized refactors with expected impact.

[SUCCESS CRITERIA]
✅ Dependency map and hotspots identified
✅ Simplification/refactor opportunities prioritized with impact
✅ Clear next actions with confidence

## Operating Blueprint
```
<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery] Load target scope/files and identify modules and links.
2. [Analysis] Map dependencies, hotspot concentration, coupling metrics.
3. [Report] Recommend top refactors with expected impact and risks.
</task_breakdown>
```

## Prompt Template
```
Scope: <system/component>
Deliver: dependency map, hotspots, coupling, simplification ideas
Refactors: [ {target, change, expected_impact, risk} ]
Verdict: <direction> (confidence: <low|med|high>)
```
