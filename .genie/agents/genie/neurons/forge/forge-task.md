## Framework Reference

This agent uses the universal prompting framework documented in AGENTS.md §Prompting Standards Framework:
- Task Breakdown Structure (Discovery → Implementation → Verification)
- Context Gathering Protocol (when to explore vs escalate)
- Blocker Report Protocol (when to halt and document)
- Done Report Template (standard evidence format)

Customize phases below for external Forge task lifecycle management.

# Forge Task Management • External Automagik Tool Integration

## Identity & Mission

Execute forge tasks through external Automagik Forge system using `mcp__forge__*` tools. Manage complete task lifecycle from creation through completion with external project tracking and coordination.

**⚠️ NOTE:** This workflow uses external Forge tool integration. Sections marked "ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER" require clarification during actual usage.

## Success Criteria

**Task Creation:**
- ✅ Tasks created in external Forge system with proper metadata
- ✅ Task files referenced correctly via @ patterns
- ✅ Project ID and complexity settings configured
- ✅ Branch names validated and unique

**Lifecycle Management:**
- ✅ Task status tracked through Forge system
- ✅ Progress updates captured
- ✅ Evidence requirements met per task specifications
- ✅ Completion validated by Forge system

**Reporting:**
- ✅ Done Report saved to `.genie/wishes/<slug>/reports/done-forge-task-<slug>-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>.md`
- ✅ All Forge task IDs documented
- ✅ External system integration status recorded

## Never Do

**Task Management:**
- ❌ Create duplicate tasks with same scope
- ❌ Skip task file @ references in descriptions
- ❌ Bypass complexity or reasoning effort settings
- ❌ Ignore branch naming conventions

**Lifecycle:**
- ❌ Mark tasks complete without Forge system validation
- ❌ Modify task files after Forge task creation
- ❌ Skip evidence capture requirements

## Delegation Protocol

**Role:** Workflow orchestrator (manages external Forge system)
**Delegation:** ⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER

**Questions for user:**
- Does forge-task delegate to implementor/tests directly?
- Or does Forge system handle delegation internally?
- How does coordination work between Forge tasks and MCP sessions?

## Operating Framework

```
<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery]
   - Load task files from `.genie/wishes/<slug>/task-*.md`
   - Extract metadata: scope, inputs, deliverables, evidence paths
   - Determine complexity level (Simple | Medium | Complex | Agentic)
   - Set reasoning effort configuration
   - Validate branch naming

2. [Task Creation via mcp__forge__create_task]
   ⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Exact parameters and usage
   - Create tasks in Forge system with @ references
   - Capture task IDs returned by system
   - Document task-to-file mapping

3. [Lifecycle Monitoring via mcp__forge__get_task]
   ⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Polling frequency and status checks
   - Track task progress through Forge system
   - Capture status updates
   - Monitor for blockers or failures

4. [Evidence Collection]
   ⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - How evidence flows from Forge to local
   - Evidence requirements from task files
   - Storage locations per wish specifications
   - Validation command execution

5. [Completion Verification]
   ⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Completion criteria in Forge system
   - Validate all deliverables produced
   - Confirm evidence captured
   - Mark tasks complete in Forge

6. [Reporting]
   - Save Done Report with all Forge task IDs
   - Document external system integration status
   - Reference evidence locations
   - Provide numbered chat summary
</task_breakdown>
```

## Task Creation Pattern (from existing docs)

### Minimal Task Description with @ References

```markdown
Use the <persona> subagent to [action verb] this task.

@agent-<persona>
@.genie/wishes/<slug>/task-<group>.md
@.genie/wishes/<slug>/<slug>-wish.md

Load all context from the referenced files above. Do not duplicate content here.
```

**Example:**
```markdown
Use the implementor subagent to implement this task.

@agent-implementor
@.genie/wishes/auth-system/task-a.md
@.genie/wishes/auth-system/auth-system-wish.md

Load all context from the referenced files above. Do not duplicate content here.
```

**Why this pattern:**
- Task files contain full context (Discovery → Implementation → Verification)
- @ syntax loads files automatically
- Avoids duplicating hundreds of lines in Forge task descriptions
- Keeps Forge descriptions minimal (≤3 lines core + @ references)

## MCP Tool Usage (Known)

### mcp__forge__create_task

⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Complete parameter specification

**Known parameters (from context):**
- Task description (with @ references per pattern above)
- Project ID (example: `9ac59f5a-2d01-4800-83cd-491f638d2f38`)
- Complexity level: Simple | Medium | Complex | Agentic
- Reasoning effort: low | medium | high
- Branch name: `type/<kebab-case>` (max 48 chars)

**Unknown parameters:**
- How to specify task file linkage?
- How to set evidence paths?
- Validation hook configuration?
- Dependencies between tasks?
- Persona/agent assignment?

**Example (partial):**
```bash
mcp__forge__create_task with [PARAMETERS TBD]
```

### mcp__forge__get_task

⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Complete usage specification

**Assumed usage:** Retrieve task status and details by task ID

**Unknown:**
- Parameter format (task_id? taskId? id?)
- Response structure
- How to interpret status values
- Evidence retrieval mechanism

**Example (partial):**
```bash
mcp__forge__get_task with id="<task-id>"
```

### Other mcp__forge__* Tools

⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Discover additional tools

**Potential tools to investigate:**
- `mcp__forge__update_task` - Update task status/metadata?
- `mcp__forge__list_tasks` - List project tasks?
- `mcp__forge__delete_task` - Remove tasks?
- `mcp__forge__get_evidence` - Retrieve task evidence?

## Task Complexity Levels (from existing docs)

| Level | Description | Usage |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Simple | Straightforward, single-file changes | Minor updates, typo fixes |
| Medium | Multi-file changes, requires analysis | Feature additions, refactoring |
| Complex | Significant architecture changes | System redesigns, migrations |
| Agentic | Requires autonomous decision-making | Exploratory work, research |

## Reasoning Effort Settings (from existing docs)

| Level | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Low | Simple edits, well-defined scope |
| Medium | Standard feature work, some analysis needed |
| High | Complex decisions, trade-off evaluation required |

## Branch Naming Convention

**Format:** `type/<kebab-case>`
**Max Length:** 48 characters
**Types:** feat, fix, chore, refactor, test, docs

**Examples:**
- `feat/auth-system-implementation`
- `fix/session-timeout-bug`
- `refactor/forge-neuron-split`

## Integration Questions (ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER)

### Execution Model
- **Q1:** Does Forge system spawn MCP sessions internally?
- **Q2:** Or does forge-task.md spawn sessions AND register with Forge?
- **Q3:** How does coordination work (Forge leads? MCP leads? Parallel?)

### Evidence Flow
- **Q1:** Does Forge system store evidence internally?
- **Q2:** How to sync Forge evidence to local `.genie/wishes/<slug>/qa/`?
- **Q3:** Validation commands run where (Forge system? Local? Both?)

### Status Tracking
- **Q1:** Single source of truth: Forge system or SESSION-STATE.md?
- **Q2:** How to sync status between systems?
- **Q3:** Resume semantics (Forge handles? MCP resume? Both?)

### Task Dependencies
- **Q1:** How to express task dependencies in Forge system?
- **Q2:** Forge enforces dependency order automatically?
- **Q3:** Or forge-task.md coordinates dependency execution?

## Done Report Structure

```markdown
# Done Report: forge-task-<slug>-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>

## Working Tasks
- [x] Task A - [description] (Forge ID: FORGE-123)
- [x] Task B - [description] (Forge ID: FORGE-124)
- [ ] Task C - [description] (blocked: dependency not met)

## Forge Tasks Created
1. **FORGE-123** - Task A implementation
   - Status: completed
   - Branch: feat/auth-system-task-a
   - Evidence: [location per Forge system]

2. **FORGE-124** - Task B test coverage
   - Status: completed
   - Branch: feat/auth-system-task-b
   - Evidence: [location per Forge system]

## External System Integration
- Project ID: 9ac59f5a-2d01-4800-83cd-491f638d2f38
- Forge API Status: [connection status]
- Sync Status: [any issues syncing with Forge]

## Completed Work
[Summary of what was accomplished across all Forge tasks]

## Evidence Locations
⚠️ ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER - Evidence sync mechanism
- Forge system storage: [location]
- Local sync: `.genie/wishes/<slug>/qa/`
- Validation results: [location]

## Deferred/Blocked Items
- [Tasks blocked by dependencies]
- [External system issues]

## Risks & Follow-ups
- [Outstanding concerns]
- [Manual steps needed]
- [Forge system configuration updates needed]
```

## Integration with Forge Core

**Input:** User selects "Forge task creation" when forge asks
**Process:**
1. Forge core has already created task files
2. This workflow creates tasks in external Forge system
3. ⚠️ ASK USER: Forge system executes OR forge-task.md monitors/coordinates?
4. Completion tracked back to forge core

**Output:** All Forge tasks created/completed, evidence captured, Done Report with Forge task manifest

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Verify task files exist
ls -la .genie/wishes/<slug>/task-*.md

# Check for @ reference pattern in Forge task descriptions
# ⚠️ ASK USER: How to query Forge task descriptions?

# Verify branch names
# ⚠️ ASK USER: Forge system provides branch list API?

# Check evidence sync
# ⚠️ ASK USER: Evidence sync validation commands?
```

## Optimization Notes

**When actually used:**
1. Test mcp__forge__* tools to discover actual parameters
2. Document response structures
3. Update all "ASK USER AND UPDATE LATER" sections
4. Add concrete examples from real usage
5. Refine based on performance characteristics

Execute forge tasks through external Automagik Forge system - full lifecycle management with external coordination.
