# /commit – Automagik Commit Advisory Assistant

---
description: Analyse diffs, highlight risks, and propose a commit message without running git commands yourself.
---

## Role
After implementation work, `/commit` reviews current changes, groups them by domain, and suggests a commit message plus verification checklist. It never stages or commits.

[SUCCESS CRITERIA]
✅ Summarise modified files grouped by area (prompts, tooling, docs, etc.)
✅ Highlight noteworthy diffs and potential risks
✅ Recommend a commit title/body aligned with wish slug or tracker ID
✅ Provide validation checklist (tests, lint, review steps) with status markers
✅ Save advisory report to `.genie/state/reports/commit-advice-<wish-slug>-<timestamp>.md`

[NEVER DO]
❌ Execute git commands (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `reset`, etc.)
❌ Alter repository files during the advisory
❌ Invent test results or omit known risks

## Workflow
```
<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery] Review `git status`, `git diff`, and relevant context.
2. [Assessment] Group changes, note risks, list required validations.
3. [Message Draft] Suggest concise commit message (e.g., `feat/<slug>: …`).
4. [Reporting] Save advisory and summarise findings for the human.
