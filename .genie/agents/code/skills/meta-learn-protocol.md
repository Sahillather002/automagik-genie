# Meta-Learn & Behavioral Corrections

Use the unified `learn` meta-learning agent to capture violations, new patterns, workflows, and capabilities in one place. It records behavioural guardrails, propagates edits, and produces evidence reports.

**When to Use:**
- ✅ A behavioural rule was violated and needs a corrective entry
- ✅ A recurring pattern or workflow must be documented across agents
- ✅ A new capability or guardrail affects multiple prompts/docs
- ✅ You need to log evidence and monitoring plans for future validation

**How to Invoke:**
1. `/learn "Violation: …"`, `/learn "Pattern: …"`, etc. (preferred for slash-command flows)
2. `mcp__genie__run with agent="learn" and prompt="<Teaching input block>"` (for MCP execution)

**Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Editing `AGENTS.md` behavioural learnings manually without the learn agent
- ❌ Recording speculative rules without evidence or validation steps
- ❌ Skipping concrete follow-up plans or command evidence

**Result:** Learn updates `AGENTS.md`, patches affected prompts/docs, and saves a Done Report at `.genie/wishes/<slug>/reports/done-learn-<slug>-<timestamp>.md` detailing scope, diffs, and monitoring.
