# Product Mission (Lite)

{{PROJECT_NAME}} is a template-first agent/CLI framework that installs into any repository to orchestrate planning, wishing, forging, review, and commit workflows. Replace project-specific language with placeholders.

It serves open‑source builders and enterprise teams who need sub‑second speech latency, natural overlap/interruptions, and an experiment harness to discover which strategies feel most human. Unlike traditional stacks, it gives raw WebSocket control of TTS/STT streams, advanced turn‑taking, and built‑in evaluation to iterate toward human‑level conversation.
