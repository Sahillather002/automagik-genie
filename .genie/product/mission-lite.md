# Product Mission (Lite)

Automagik Hello is a real‑time voice application framework for building ultra‑low‑latency, truly human‑like conversational agents.

It serves open‑source builders and enterprise teams who need sub‑second speech latency, natural overlap/interruptions, and an experiment harness to discover which strategies feel most human. Unlike traditional stacks, it gives raw WebSocket control of TTS/STT streams, advanced turn‑taking, and built‑in evaluation to iterate toward human‑level conversation.
