# Tracer Customization Template

> Populate repository-specific defaults for the `tracer` agent. These notes are included by the core prompt and should stay focused on guidance, not instructions for other agents.

## Commands & Tools

- [ ] Extra reporting expectations or stakeholder notifications.

<!-- Add further sections if the project needs specialised guidance for this agent. -->
