## 🔧 Features Validated

### Session Name Architecture (#146)
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**What Was Tested:**
- Session name storage in sessions.json
- Name-based indexing (v3 format)
- Migration from v2 (sessionId-keyed) to v3 (name-keyed)
- Stale lock reclamation with migration

**Evidence:**
- Test 3 includes migration: `[Warning] Migrating sessions.json from v2 (sessionId-keyed) to v3 (name-keyed)`
- Migration successful: Test passed after migration

### Session Service Robustness
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED

**Concurrent Operations:**
- Atomic write protection tested
- Lock retry on contention tested
- Concurrent writes handled correctly
- No race conditions detected

**State Management:**
- Stale lock reclamation working
- Fresh reload before merge validated
- Session persistence confirmed

## 🐛 Known Issues (Non-Blocking)

### Issue: Agent Permission Loops
**Severity:** LOW (does not affect end users)
**Description:** Git agent and QA agent hit permission loops when trying to delegate
**Impact:** Internal testing only - user-facing functionality unaffected
**Workaround:** Direct CLI/tool usage for QA operations
**Fix Plan:** Not required for RC28 (addressed in future Forge integration)
