## Executive Summary

### Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS - NEW CRITICAL BUG FOUND

**✅ Original Bug Fixed:**
- View command now successfully reads from Codex session files
- Full conversation history is displayed when session exists in sessions.json
- Implementation correctly locates session files using `locateSessionFile()`

**❌ NEW CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED:**
- **Both `view` and `resume` commands fail if session is not in sessions.json**
- Session file may exist in `~/.codex/sessions/` but commands fail with "Run not found"
- Affects user's session `01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7` and potentially many others

**Recommendation:** NO-GO for commit. Critical regression must be fixed first.

## Detailed Test Case Results

### TC1: Basic Run → Resume → View Workflow ✅

**Test Execution:**
```bash
./genie run utilities/thinkdeep "TC1: My favorite number is 42"
# Session ID: 0199981e-5d92-71a2-96d0-187848797a5f

./genie resume 0199981e-5d92-71a2-96d0-187848797a5f "TC1 follow-up: What was my favorite number?"
# Resume successful

./genie view 0199981e-5d92-71a2-96d0-187848797a5f --full
# View successful - full conversation visible
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS

**Evidence:**
- Session created and tracked in sessions.json
- Resume command successfully continued conversation
- View command displayed full conversation history from session file
- Both user messages and system instructions visible in transcript

### TC2: Session Lookup Investigation ❌

**Problematic Session:** `01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7`

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# User's original command that failed
./genie resume 01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7 "what was my first message?"
# Result: ❌ Fatal error - No run found with session id '01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7'

# Attempt to view instead
./genie view 01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7
# Result: ❌ Run not found - No run found with session id '01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7'
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

1. **Session file exists:**
   ```bash
   find ~/.codex/sessions -name "*01999818*"
   # Found: ~/.codex/sessions/2025/09/29/rollout-2025-09-29T21-48-56-01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7.jsonl
   ```

2. **Session NOT in sessions.json:**
   ```bash
   cat .genie/state/agents/sessions.json | grep "01999818"
   # No results - session is NOT tracked in sessions.json
   ```

3. **Code Analysis - genie.ts Line 1153-1156 (view command):**
   ```typescript
   const found = findSessionEntry(store, sessionId, paths);
   if (!found) {
     await emitView(buildErrorView('Run not found',
       `No run found with session id '${sessionId}'`),
       parsed.options, { stream: process.stderr });
     return;  // ❌ Fails immediately without checking session file
   }
   ```

4. **Code Analysis - genie.ts Line 982-983 (resume command):**
   ```typescript
   const found = findSessionEntry(store, sessionId, paths);
   if (!found) throw new Error(`❌ No run found with session id '${sessionId}'`);
   // ❌ Fails immediately without checking session file
   ```

**The Bug:**

Both `view` and `resume` commands require the session to exist in `.genie/state/agents/sessions.json`. If a session is not tracked there (due to CLI crash, manual deletion, or state corruption), the commands fail immediately even though:
- The session file exists in `~/.codex/sessions/`
- The session file contains full conversation history
- The session ID is valid and correct

**Impact:**
- **High severity** - Breaks core functionality for orphaned sessions
- Affects users who have session files but lost sessions.json entries
- Affects sessions created before CLI tracking was robust
- Makes session recovery impossible through normal commands

**Result:** ❌ FAIL - Critical bug discovered

**Evidence Files:**
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/reports/evidence-resume-view-fix/test-transcripts/tc2-problematic-session-check.txt`
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/reports/evidence-resume-view-fix/test-transcripts/tc2-session-file-search.txt`
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/reports/evidence-resume-view-fix/test-transcripts/tc2-view-problematic-session.txt`

### TC4: Backward Compatibility ⚠️

**Commands Tested:**
```bash
./genie --help         # ✅ Works
./genie list agents    # ✅ Works
./genie list sessions  # ✅ Works
```

**Result:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS

Basic commands work, but view/resume are broken for any session not in sessions.json (see TC2).

**Evidence Files:**
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/reports/evidence-resume-view-fix/test-transcripts/tc4-regression-help.txt`
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/reports/evidence-resume-view-fix/test-transcripts/tc4-regression-list-agents.txt`

---

### TC5: System Events Visibility ✅

**Test Execution:**
```bash
./genie view 0199981e-5d92-71a2-96d0-187848797a5f --full | head -30
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS

System events (Session, Status, Executor, Execution mode, Background) are still displayed correctly in the view output header.

**Evidence:** See tc1-view-full.txt lines 1-17

## Issues Found

### Issue #1: Sessions.json Dependency Bug (CRITICAL)

**Priority:** P0 - Blocks commit
**Severity:** Critical
**Type:** Regression

**Description:**
Both `view` and `resume` commands fail if session ID is not found in sessions.json, even when the session file exists in `~/.codex/sessions/`. This makes it impossible to view or resume orphaned sessions.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Identify a session file in `~/.codex/sessions/` (e.g., `01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7`)
2. Verify it's not in `.genie/state/agents/sessions.json`
3. Try: `./genie view <sessionId>`
4. Result: "No run found with session id"
5. Try: `./genie resume <sessionId> "message"`
6. Result: Same error

**Expected Behavior:**
- `view` command should be able to find and display session file content even without sessions.json entry
- `resume` command should gracefully handle or provide helpful error for orphaned sessions
- At minimum, view should work independently of sessions.json

**Root Cause:**
Both commands call `findSessionEntry()` and fail immediately if not found, before attempting to locate the session file.

**Affected Code:**
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/cli/src/genie.ts:1153-1156` (view)
- `/home/namastex/workspace/automagik-genie/.genie/cli/src/genie.ts:982-983` (resume)

**Proposed Fix:**

For `view` command:
```typescript
// Try sessions.json first
const found = findSessionEntry(store, sessionId, paths);

// If not found, try to locate session file directly
if (!found) {
  const sessionFile = tryLocateSessionFileBySessionId(sessionId, paths);
  if (sessionFile && fs.existsSync(sessionFile)) {
    // Create minimal entry for viewing
    // Read and display session file content
    // Show warning: "Session not tracked in CLI, displaying from session file"
  } else {
    await emitView(buildErrorView('Run not found',
      `No run found with session id '${sessionId}'`),
      parsed.options, { stream: process.stderr });
    return;
  }
}
```

For `resume` command:
```typescript
const found = findSessionEntry(store, sessionId, paths);
if (!found) {
  // Check if session file exists
  const sessionFile = tryLocateSessionFileBySessionId(sessionId, paths);
  if (sessionFile && fs.existsSync(sessionFile)) {
    throw new Error(
      `❌ Session '${sessionId}' is not tracked in CLI state.\n` +
      `Session file exists but cannot be resumed without CLI tracking.\n` +
      `This may happen if sessions.json was corrupted or deleted.\n` +
      `Consider running: genie run <agent> to start a new session.`
    );
  } else {
    throw new Error(`❌ No run found with session id '${sessionId}'`);
  }
}
```

**Additional Consideration:**
Need a helper function `tryLocateSessionFileBySessionId()` that:
1. Searches `~/.codex/sessions/` directories by date
2. Pattern matches session ID in filenames
3. Returns file path or null

This would require adding to codex.ts or a new helper module.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **DO NOT COMMIT** current changes until Issue #1 is resolved
2. Implement proposed fix for view command to handle orphaned sessions
3. Implement improved error message for resume command
4. Add helper function to locate session files by ID without sessions.json
5. Re-run full QA suite after fixes

### Additional Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Session Recovery Command:**
   ```bash
   ./genie recover-sessions
   ```
   Scan `~/.codex/sessions/`, find orphaned session files, and rebuild sessions.json entries where possible.

2. **Better Session State Management:**
   - Add validation on CLI startup to check sessions.json integrity
   - Implement auto-recovery for missing entries
   - Add warning when sessions.json and session files are out of sync

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Document the sessions.json dependency
   - Explain how to recover from corrupted state
   - Add troubleshooting section for "Run not found" errors

## Conclusion

### GO/NO-GO Recommendation: ❌ NO-GO

**Rationale:**
While the original bug fix successfully implements reading from Codex session files, the implementation introduces a critical regression that blocks core functionality. The view and resume commands now fail for any session not tracked in sessions.json, even when valid session files exist.

This is unacceptable because:
1. Users cannot view or resume valid sessions due to CLI state issues
2. Session recovery becomes impossible without direct file system access
3. The bug affects the exact scenario the user encountered
4. Impact is worse than the original bug (no conversation history vs. complete command failure)

**Required Actions Before Commit:**
1. Fix view command to handle orphaned sessions gracefully
2. Improve resume command error messaging
3. Add session file discovery without sessions.json dependency
4. Re-run QA validation suite
5. Verify user's original session `01999818-09e9-74c2-926b-d2250a2ae3c7` works after fix

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours to implement proper session file discovery and error handling
