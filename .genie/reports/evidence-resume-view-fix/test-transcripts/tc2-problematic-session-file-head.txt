Replace product-specific branding with placeholders (e.g., `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{DOMAIN}}`).\n- **Primary references** (all under `.genie/` now):\n  - `@.genie/product/mission.md` / `mission-lite.md`\n  - `@.genie/product/tech-stack.md`\n  - `@.genie/product/roadmap.md`\n  - `@.genie/product/environment.md`\n  - (Optional) project-specific docs referenced by wishes, if present in target repos.\n- **External dependencies**: Template repo is domain-agnostic. Declare any provider dependencies in your project’s wish/forge plan.\n\n## Unified Agent Stack\nThe Genie workflow lives in `.genie/agents/` and is surfaced via CLI wrappers in `.claude/commands/`:\n- `plan.md` – orchestrates discovery, roadmap sync, context ledger, branch guidance\n- `wish.md` – converts planning brief into a wish with inline `<spec_contract>`\n- `forge.md` – breaks approved wish into execution groups + validation hooks (includes planner mode)\n- `review.md` – audits wish completion and produces QA reports\n- `commit.md` – aggregates diffs and proposes commit messaging\n- `prompt.md` – advanced prompting guidance stored in `.genie/agents/utilities/prompt.md`\n- Specialized agents (bug-reporter, git-workflow, implementor, polish, project-manager, qa, self-learn, tests) plus utilities (`refactorer`, `rules-integrator`). See Local Agent Map for current names.\n\nAll commands in `.claude/commands/` simply `@include` the corresponding `.genie/agents/...` file to avoid duplication.\n\n## Directory Map\n- `.genie/product/` – mission, roadmap, tech stack, planning notes, decisions\n- `.genie/standards/` – coding rules, naming, language-specific style guides\n- `.genie/instructions/` – legacy Agent OS playbooks retained for reference\n- `.genie/guides/` – getting-started docs, onboarding\n- `.genie/state/` – CLI-managed data (e.g., `agents/sessions.json` for session tracking, agent logs, forge plans, commit advisories). Inspect via `./genie list sessions` or `./genie view <sessionId>` rather than manual edits.\n- `.genie/wishes/` – active wish contracts (`<slug>-wish.md`)\n- `.genie/agents/` – entrypoint agents (`plan.md`, `wish.md`, `forge.md`, `review.md`)\n- `.genie/agents/utilities/` – reusable helpers (twin, analyze, debug, commit workflow, prompt, etc.)\n- `.genie/agents/specialists/` – delivery/QA/learning specialists\n- `./genie` – CLI runner for agent conversations\n\n## Workflow Summary\n1. **/plan** – single-entry agent for product mode. Loads mission/roadmap/standards, gathers context via `@` references, requests background personas via CLI, and decides if item is wish-ready.\n2. **/wish** – creates `.genie/wishes/<slug>-wish.md`, embedding context ledger, execution groups, inline `<spec_contract>`, branch/tracker strategy, and blocker protocol.\n3. **/forge** – surfaces execution groups, evidence expectations, validation hooks, and pointers back to the wish for tracker updates (capture the plan summary inside the wish).\n4. **Implementation** – humans/agents follow forge plan, storing evidence exactly where the wish specifies (no default folders). Specialist agents run via `./genie run <specialist-agent> \"...\"`. Tailor the files in `.genie/agents/specialists/` during installation.\n5. **/review** (optional) – aggregates QA artefacts, replays validation commands, and writes a review summary back into the wish (create a dedicated section or file path if needed).\n6. **/commit** – groups diffs, recommends commit message/checklist, and outputs a commit advisory (log highlights inside the wish or PR draft).\n7. **Git workflow** – Branch names typically `feat/<wish-slug>`; alternatives logged in the wish. PRs reference the wish and forge plan, and reuse tracker IDs recorded in the wish itself. Update roadmap status after merge.\n\n## Evidence & Storage Conventions\n- Wishes must declare where artefacts live; there is no default `qa/` directory. Capture metrics inline in the wish (e.g., tables under a **Metrics** section) or in clearly named companion files.\n- Every wish must complete the **Evidence Checklist** block in @.genie/agents/wish.md before implementation begins, spelling out validation commands, artefact locations, and approval checkpoints.\n- External tracker IDs live in the wish markdown (for example a **Tracking** section with `Forge task: FORGE-123`).\n- Background agent outputs are summarised in the wish context ledger; raw logs can be viewed with `./genie view <sessionId>`.\n\n## Testing & Evaluation\n- Evaluation tooling is optional. If a project adds its own evaluator specialist, `/review` or `/plan` can reference it; otherwise, evaluation steps default to manual validation.\n- Typical metrics: `{{METRICS}}` such as latency or quality. Domain-specific metrics should be added per project in the wish/forge plan.\n- Validation hooks should be captured in wishes/forge plans (e.g., `pnpm test`, `cargo test`, metrics scripts).\n\n## Prompting Standards\n- Use Discovery → Implementation → Verification sections in agents and prompts.\n- Always reference files with `@` to auto-load content.\n- Define success/failure boundaries explicitly.\n- Encourage concrete examples/snippets over abstractions.\n- Advanced prompting guidance lives in `@.genie/agents/utilities/prompt.md`.\n\n## Branch & Tracker Guidance\n- **Dedicated branch** (`feat/<wish-slug>`) for medium/large changes.\n- **Existing branch** only with documented rationale (wish status log).\n- **Micro-task** for tiny updates; track in wish status and commit advisory.\n- Tracker IDs (from forge execution output) should be logged in the wish markdown once assigned. Capture them immediately after `/forge` reports IDs.\n\nA common snippet:\n\n```\n### Tracking\n- Forge task: FORGE-123\n```\n\n## Blocker Protocol\n1. Log the blocker directly in the wish (timestamped entry with findings and status).\n2. Update the wish status log and notify stakeholders.\n3. Resume only after guidance is updated.\n\n## CLI Quick Reference\n```bash\n# Helper\n./genie --help\n\n# Start a Genie Flow (built-in agents)\n./genie run plan \"[Discovery] … [Implementation] … [Verification] …\"\n\n# Start a Core/Specialized Agent\n./genie run forge \"[Discovery] … [Implementation] … [Verification] …\"\n\n# Inspect runs and view logs (friendly)\n./genie list sessions\n./genie view <sessionId> --full\n\n# Continue a specific run by session id\n./genie resume <sessionId> \"Follow-up …\"\n\n# Stop a session\n./genie stop <sessionId>\n```\n\n### Conversations & Resume\n`resume` enables an actual, continuous conversation with agents and is how you continue multi‑turn tasks.\n\n- Start a session: `./genie run <agent> \"<prompt>\"`\n- Resume the same session: `./genie resume <sessionId> \"<next prompt>\"`\n- Inspect context so far: `./genie view <sessionId> --full`\n- Discover session ids: `./genie list sessions`\n\nGuidance:\n- Treat each session as a thread with memory; use `resume` for follow‑ups instead of starting new `run`s.\n- Keep work per session focused (one wish/feature/bug) for clean transcripts and easier review.\n- When scope changes significantly, start a new `run` and reference the prior session in your prompt.\n\n## Chat-Mode Helpers (Scoped Use Only)\nGenie can handle small, interactive requests without entering Plan → Wish when the scope is clearly limited. Preferred helpers:\n\n- `utilities/debug` – root-cause investigations or “why is this broken?” questions\n- `utilities/codereview` – quick reviews of a small diff/file for severity-tagged feedback\n- `utilities/analyze` – explain current architecture or module behaviour at a high level\n- `utilities/thinkdeep` – timeboxed exploratory reasoning/research\n- `utilities/consensus` / `utilities/challenge` – pressure-test decisions or assumptions rapidly\n- `utilities/prompt` – rewrite instructions, wish sections, or prompts on the fly\n\nIf the task grows beyond a quick assist (requires new tests, broad refactor, multi-file changes), escalate into `/plan` to restart the full Plan → Wish → Forge pipeline. Bug reports that need tracking should route through the **bug-reporter** specialist so evidence is captured and filed as an issue.\n\n## Subagents & Twin via CLI\n- Start subagent: `./genie run <agent> \"<prompt>\"`\n- Resume session: `./genie resume <sessionId> \"<prompt>\"`\n- List sessions: `./genie list sessions`\n- Stop session: `./genie stop <sessionId>`\n\nTwin prompt patterns (run through any agent, typically `plan`):\n- Twin Planning: \"Act as an independent architect. Pressure-test this plan. Deliver 3 risks, 3 missing validations, 3 refinements. Finish with Twin Verdict + confidence.\"\n- Consensus Loop: \"Challenge my conclusion. Provide counterpoints, evidence, and a recommendation. Finish with Twin Verdict + confidence.\"\n- Focused Deep-Dive: \"Investigate <topic>.

Objective: pressure-test @.genie/wishes/<slug>-wish.md. Deliver 3 risks, 3 missing validations, 3 refinements. Finish with Twin Verdict + confidence.\"`\n- Resume: `./genie resume <sessionId> \"Follow-up: address risk #2 with options + trade-offs.\"`\n- Sessions: reuse the same agent name; the CLI persists session id automatically and can be viewed with `./genie list sessions`.\n- Logs: check full transcript with `./genie view <sessionId>`.\n\n### Modes (quick reference)\n- planning, consensus, deep-dive, debug, socratic, debate, risk-audit, design-review, test-strategy, compliance, retrospective.\n- Full prompt templates live in `@.genie/agents/utilities/twin.md`.\n\n### Outputs & Evidence\n- Low-stakes: append a short summary to the wish discovery section.\n- High-stakes: save a Done Report at `.genie/reports/done-twin-<slug>-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>.md` with scope, findings, recommendations, disagreements.\n- Always include “Twin Verdict: <summary> (confidence: <low|med|high>)”.\n\n### Twin Verdict Format (per mode)\nUse a compact, scannable block.

Loads mission/roadmap/standards, gathers context via `@` references, requests background personas via CLI, and decides if item is wish-ready.\n2. **/wish** – creates `.genie/wishes/<slug>-wish.md`, embedding context ledger, execution groups, inline `<spec_contract>`, branch/tracker strategy, and blocker protocol.\n3. **/forge** – surfaces execution groups, evidence expectations, validation hooks, and pointers back to the wish for tracker updates (capture the plan summary inside the wish).\n4. **Implementation** – humans/agents follow forge plan, storing evidence exactly where the wish specifies (no default folders). Specialist agents run via `./genie run <specialist-agent> \"...\"`. Tailor the files in `.genie/agents/specialists/` during installation.\n5. **/review** (optional) – aggregates QA artefacts, replays validation commands, and writes a review summary back into the wish (create a dedicated section or file path if needed).\n6. **/commit** – groups diffs, recommends commit message/checklist, and outputs a commit advisory (log highlights inside the wish or PR draft).\n7. **Git workflow** – Branch names typically `feat/<wish-slug>`; alternatives logged in the wish. PRs reference the wish and forge plan, and reuse tracker IDs recorded in the wish itself. Update roadmap status after merge.\n\n## Evidence & Storage Conventions\n- Wishes must declare where artefacts live; there is no default `qa/` directory. Capture metrics inline in the wish (e.g., tables under a **Metrics** section) or in clearly named companion files.\n- Every wish must complete the **Evidence Checklist** block in @.genie/agents/wish.md before implementation begins, spelling out validation commands, artefact locations, and approval checkpoints.\n- External tracker IDs live in the wish markdown (for example a **Tracking** section with `Forge task: FORGE-123`).\n- Background agent outputs are summarised in the wish context ledger; raw logs can be viewed with `./genie view <sessionId>`.\n\n## Testing & Evaluation\n- Evaluation tooling is optional. If a project adds its own evaluator specialist, `/review` or `/plan` can reference it; otherwise, evaluation steps default to manual validation.\n- Typical metrics: `{{METRICS}}` such as latency or quality. Domain-specific metrics should be added per project in the wish/forge plan.\n- Validation hooks should be captured in wishes/forge plans (e.g., `pnpm test`, `cargo test`, metrics scripts).\n\n## Prompting Standards\n- Use Discovery → Implementation → Verification sections in agents and prompts.\n- Always reference files with `@` to auto-load content.\n- Define success/failure boundaries explicitly.\n- Encourage concrete examples/snippets over abstractions.\n- Advanced prompting guidance lives in `@.genie/agents/utilities/prompt.md`.\n\n## Branch & Tracker Guidance\n- **Dedicated branch** (`feat/<wish-slug>`) for medium/large changes.\n- **Existing branch** only with documented rationale (wish status log).\n- **Micro-task** for tiny updates; track in wish status and commit advisory.\n- Tracker IDs (from forge execution output) should be logged in the wish markdown once assigned. Capture them immediately after `/forge` reports IDs.\n\nA common snippet:\n\n```\n### Tracking\n- Forge task: FORGE-123\n```\n\n## Blocker Protocol\n1. Log the blocker directly in the wish (timestamped entry with findings and status).\n2. Update the wish status log and notify stakeholders.\n3. Resume only after guidance is updated.\n\n## CLI Quick Reference\n```bash\n# Helper\n./genie --help\n\n# Start a Genie Flow (built-in agents)\n./genie run plan \"[Discovery] … [Implementation] … [Verification] …\"\n\n# Start a Core/Specialized Agent\n./genie run forge \"[Discovery] … [Implementation] … [Verification] …\"\n\n# Inspect runs and view logs (friendly)\n./genie list sessions\n./genie view <sessionId> --full\n\n# Continue a specific run by session id\n./genie resume <sessionId> \"Follow-up …\"\n\n# Stop a session\n./genie stop <sessionId>\n```\n\n### Conversations & Resume\n`resume` enables an actual, continuous conversation with agents and is how you continue multi‑turn tasks.\n\n- Start a session: `./genie run <agent> \"<prompt>\"`\n- Resume the same session: `./genie resume <sessionId> \"<next prompt>\"`\n- Inspect context so far: `./genie view <sessionId> --full`\n- Discover session ids: `./genie list sessions`\n\nGuidance:\n- Treat each session as a thread with memory; use `resume` for follow‑ups instead of starting new `run`s.\n- Keep work per session focused (one wish/feature/bug) for clean transcripts and easier review.\n- When scope changes significantly, start a new `run` and reference the prior session in your prompt.\n\n## Chat-Mode Helpers (Scoped Use Only)\nGenie can handle small, interactive requests without entering Plan → Wish when the scope is clearly limited. Preferred helpers:\n\n- `utilities/debug` – root-cause investigations or “why is this broken?” questions\n- `utilities/codereview` – quick reviews of a small diff/file for severity-tagged feedback\n- `utilities/analyze` – explain current architecture or module behaviour at a high level\n- `utilities/thinkdeep` – timeboxed exploratory reasoning/research\n- `utilities/consensus` / `utilities/challenge` – pressure-test decisions or assumptions rapidly\n- `utilities/prompt` – rewrite instructions, wish sections, or prompts on the fly\n\nIf the task grows beyond a quick assist (requires new tests, broad refactor, multi-file changes), escalate into `/plan` to restart the full Plan → Wish → Forge pipeline. Bug reports that need tracking should route through the **bug-reporter** specialist so evidence is captured and filed as an issue.\n\n## Subagents & Twin via CLI\n- Start subagent: `./genie run <agent> \"<prompt>\"`\n- Resume session: `./genie resume <sessionId> \"<prompt>\"`\n- List sessions: `./genie list sessions`\n- Stop session: `./genie stop <sessionId>`\n\nTwin prompt patterns (run through any agent, typically `plan`):\n- Twin Planning: \"Act as an independent architect. Pressure-test this plan. Deliver 3 risks, 3 missing validations, 3 refinements. Finish with Twin Verdict + confidence.\"\n- Consensus Loop: \"Challenge my conclusion. Provide counterpoints, evidence, and a recommendation. Finish with Twin Verdict + confidence.\"\n- Focused Deep-Dive: \"Investigate <topic>.

Objective: pressure-test @.genie/wishes/<slug>-wish.md. Deliver 3 risks, 3 missing validations, 3 refinements. Finish with Twin Verdict + confidence.\"`\n- Resume: `./genie resume <sessionId> \"Follow-up: address risk #2 with options + trade-offs.\"`\n- Sessions: reuse the same agent name; the CLI persists session id automatically and can be viewed with `./genie list sessions`.\n- Logs: check full transcript with `./genie view <sessionId>`.\n\n### Modes (quick reference)\n- planning, consensus, deep-dive, debug, socratic, debate, risk-audit, design-review, test-strategy, compliance, retrospective.\n- Full prompt templates live in `@.genie/agents/utilities/twin.md`.\n\n### Outputs & Evidence\n- Low-stakes: append a short summary to the wish discovery section.\n- High-stakes: save a Done Report at `.genie/reports/done-twin-<slug>-<YYYYMMDDHHmm>.md` with scope, findings, recommendations, disagreements.\n- Always include “Twin Verdict: <summary> (confidence: <low|med|high>)”.\n\n### Twin Verdict Format (per mode)\nUse a compact, scannable block.
