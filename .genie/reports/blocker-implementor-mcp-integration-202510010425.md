# Blocker Report: implementor-mcp-integration-202510010425

## Summary
Attempted to begin Group A extraction with TDD. Added failing coverage in `tests/genie-cli.test.js` expecting new `cli-core` factory and `SessionService` guarded by `proper-lockfile`. Red stage captured via `pnpm run test:genie`.

While moving into implementation, requirement #2 mandates `SessionService` use the `proper-lockfile` package. With `approval_policy=never` and `network_access=restricted`, `pnpm add proper-lockfile` (or any registry fetch) cannot run—installing the dependency is impossible in the current environment. Without the library we cannot safely implement file locking/optimistic merge as specified by the Twin-approved mitigations.

## Evidence
- `pnpm run test:genie` (red) now fails because the new test imports `.genie/cli/dist/cli-core`, which will exist only after completing the refactor.
- No ability to fetch `proper-lockfile`; sandbox rejects network installs, and local `node_modules` does not already contain the package.

## Recommendation
Please provide guidance on one of the following paths:
1. Authorize an alternate delivery mechanism for `proper-lockfile` (prebundled tarball, manual vendoring, etc.).
2. Approve a substitute locking strategy that does not rely on the package (e.g., custom advisory lock implementation).
3. Temporarily relax requirement #2 so extraction can land without locking, deferring concurrency safety to a follow-up once dependencies are available.

Once dependency availability is resolved, I can resume GREEN implementation—current git diff only includes the RED-stage test additions.
