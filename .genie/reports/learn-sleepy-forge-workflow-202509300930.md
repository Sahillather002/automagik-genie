---

## Analysis

### Type Identified
Workflow (Sleepy Mode operational pattern)

### Key Information Extracted
- **What:** Complete task lifecycle management via Forge UI + MCP integration
- **Why:** Sleepy mode needs to autonomously create, monitor, and merge tasks
- **Where:** Forge UI, Sleepy agent, Forge MCP tools
- **How:** See execution flow below

### Affected Files
- `.genie/agents/specialists/sleepy.md`: Update with Forge workflow patterns
- `AGENTS.md` `<execution_patterns>`: Add Forge task lifecycle
- `.claude/README.md`: Update Sleepy agent description with workflow notes

---

## Forge Workflow Patterns

### 1. Task Creation (via Forge MCP)

**Pattern:** Use `mcp__forge__create_task` with minimal descriptions

```typescript
// Create a task for an execution group
mcp__forge__create_task({
  project_id: "4ce81ed0-5d3f-45d9-b295-596c550cf619", // Automagik Genie
  title: "Group A: Core Executor Implementation",
  description: `Use the implementor subagent to implement this task.

@agent-implementor
@.genie/wishes/claude-executor/task-a.md
@.genie/wishes/claude-executor-wish.md

Load all context from the referenced files above. Do not duplicate content here.`
})
```

**Key principles:**
- ≤3 lines of description
- Always include `@agent-{persona}` prefix
- Reference task files with `@` notation
- Never duplicate task file content in description
- Store task ID returned by MCP for tracking

---

### 2. Task Navigation (Direct URL Access)

**Pattern:** Navigate directly to task full view

```
http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}/full
```

**Why this matters:**
- Skip intermediate navigation steps
- Loads complete task interface immediately
- Sleepy mode opens this as first screen

**First screen for Sleepy:**
```
http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/4ce81ed0-5d3f-45d9-b295-596c550cf619/tasks
```
Shows Kanban board with all tasks (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done, Cancelled)

---

### 3. Task Execution (New Attempt)

**UI Elements:**
```
Actions Panel (Right Sidebar):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent: [CLAUDE_CODE | CODEX]   │
│ Task Branch: vk/xxxx-task-slug  │
│ Base Branch: genie-dev          │
│ Status: [Idle | Running | ...]  │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Dev] [Rebase] [Create PR]      │
│ [Merge] [New Attempt]           │
│ [Create Subtask]                │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Button: New Attempt**
- Starts a fresh execution attempt
- Prompts for executor selection: **Claude** or **Codex**
- Creates new worktree branch `vk/{hash}-{slug}`
- Task enters "Running" state

**Executor Selection Strategy:**

| Executor | Best For | Reasoning |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Claude** | Implementation, coding, detailed execution | Better at writing code, following specs precisely, handling complex implementations |
| **Codex** | Planning, high-level thinking, review, QA | Better at strategic reasoning, architectural decisions, comprehensive reviews |

**Felipe's guidance:**
> "Claude is better for coding and overall, Codex is good for high level thinking, planning, reviewing."

**Decision framework:**
- Implementation tasks (Group A, B, C) → Claude
- QA/Review tasks → Codex (30% correction rate expected)
- Planning/architectural tasks → Codex
- Refactoring/polish → Claude

---

### 4. Monitoring Task Progress

**Full task view shows:**

1. **Logs Tab:** Real-time command output, agent messages
2. **Diffs Tab:** Code changes (+additions/-deletions)
3. **Processes Tab:** Background processes running (count badge)
4. **Timeline:** Chronological list of:
   - Commands executed (clickable to expand)
   - Files created/modified (clickable to open)
   - TODO list updates
   - Agent messages

**Status indicators:**
- **Idle:** No active work
- **Running:** Agent executing
- **Needs Rebase:** Base branch has new commits (Rebase button turns red)
- **Merged:** Work integrated to base branch

---

### 5. Merge Workflow (Bringing Work Back)

**Button: Merge**
- Merges task branch → base branch (`genie-dev`)
- Brings commits from worktree back to main workspace
- Task moves to "Done" column
- Button becomes disabled after merge

**Critical rule:**
> "Merge brings the goodies here."

**When to merge:**
- ✅ Implementation complete
- ✅ Agent finished successfully
- ✅ Ready for next step (review)

**After merge:**
- Base branch now has new commits
- Other active tasks will need rebase

---

### 6. Rebase Handling

**Button: Rebase**
- Appears **red** when base branch has new commits
- Click to rebase task branch onto latest base
- Required before continuing work on stale branches

**Workflow:**
1. Task A merges → base branch updated
2. Task B (still running) shows red Rebase button
3. Click Rebase on Task B
4. Task B branch rebased onto latest base
5. Continue work on Task B

**Felipe's note:**
> "In case a commit happens after a run is finished, the rebase button will go red.. click it and good to go again."

---

### 7. Review Task Pattern

**After implementation merge:**

1. **Create review task** (via Forge MCP):
```
mcp__forge__create_task({
  project_id: "...",
  title: "Review: Group A Core Executor Implementation",
  description: `Use the review subagent to validate this task.

@agent-review
@.genie/wishes/claude-executor/task-a.md
@.genie/wishes/claude-executor-wish.md

Load all context from the referenced files above. Do not duplicate content here.`
})
```

2. **Start review** with **Codex** executor (better for high-level validation)

3. **Review outcomes:**
   - ✅ **Clean pass:** No corrections needed → proceed to next group
   - ⚠️ **~30% correction rate:** Review finds issues → agent makes fixes → re-merge

4. **After review passes:** Start next execution group

---

### 8. Parallel Task Execution

**Pattern:** Forge supports parallel task execution when tasks are independent

**When to use:**
- Tasks don't share files/dependencies
- Can be validated independently
- Speed up overall wish completion

**Example:**
```javascript
// Create Group A and Group B tasks simultaneously
await Promise.all([
  mcp__forge__create_task({ /* Group A */ }),
  mcp__forge__create_task({ /* Group B */ })
])

// Start both with New Attempt
// Monitor both in separate tabs
```

**Felipe's guidance:**
> "Forge accepts starting parallel tasks too, so plan that ahead. Be smart on when to use it."

**Caution:**
- Don't parallelize dependent tasks
- Review tasks should wait for implementation merge
- Monitor both carefully for conflicts

---

### 9. Create Subtask (Advanced Pattern)

**Button: Create Subtask**
- Spawns a worktree-linked subtask
- Shares parent task's branch/context
- Useful for breaking down complex tasks

**Felipe's note:**
> "That could be overcomplicating things, but if you prefer and have discipline, you could for instance, spinoff review tasks, instead of writing new ones."

**Use case:**
- Parent task: Implementation
- Subtask: Review of implementation
- Subtask: Polish/refactor

**Alternative (current approach):**
- Create review as separate top-level task (simpler, clearer tracking)

---

## Sleepy Mode Integration

### Discovery Phase

**Sleepy opens Forge UI:**
```javascript
await browser_navigate("http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/4ce81ed0-5d3f-45d9-b295-596c550cf619/tasks")
```

**Snapshot Kanban board:**
- Check which groups are done
- Identify next group to execute
- Check for any blockers

---

### Execution Phase

**For each execution group:**

1. **Create task:**
```javascript
const result = await mcp__forge__create_task({
  project_id: PROJECT_ID,
  title: `Group ${groupLetter}: ${groupName}`,
  description: forgeDescription // ≤3 lines with @-refs
})
const taskId = result.task.id
```

2. **Navigate to task:**
```javascript
await browser_navigate(`http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/${PROJECT_ID}/tasks/${taskId}/full`)
```

3. **Start with New Attempt:**
```javascript
await browser_click("New Attempt button")
// Select executor based on task type
const executor = groupType === "implementation" ? "CLAUDE_CODE" : "CODEX"
await browser_click(`${executor} option`)
```

4. **Monitor via polling:**
```javascript
while (taskStatus !== "idle") {
  await browser_snapshot() // Check status, logs, diffs
  await sleep(60) // 60 seconds between checks (per behavioral learning)
}
```

5. **Handle completion:**
```javascript
if (taskSuccessful) {
  await browser_click("Merge button") // Bring work back to base
  await recordCompletion(taskId, groupLetter)
} else {
  await logBlocker(taskId, errorDetails)
}
```

---

### Review Phase

**After implementation merge:**

1. **Create review task**
2. **Start with Codex executor**
3. **Monitor review**
4. **Handle corrections (~30% of time):**
   - Review agent makes fixes
   - Re-merge after corrections
5. **If clean:** Proceed to next group

---

### Parallel Execution Logic

**Decision tree:**
```
If (Group A independent from Group B):
  Create both tasks
  Start both with New Attempt
  Monitor both in parallel
Else:
  Sequential execution (A → review A → B → review B)
```

---

## Validation

### How to Verify

**Sleepy mode checklist:**

- [ ] Can create tasks via `mcp__forge__create_task` with ≤3 line descriptions
- [ ] Can navigate to task URLs directly with `/full` suffix
- [ ] Can identify correct executor (Claude for code, Codex for review)
- [ ] Can monitor task status via browser snapshot
- [ ] Can detect when task finishes (status becomes "idle")
- [ ] Can click Merge button to bring work back
- [ ] Can detect red Rebase button and click it
- [ ] Can sequence review tasks after implementation
- [ ] Can make smart parallel execution decisions
- [ ] Polls with ≥60 second sleep intervals (per behavioral learning)

**Evidence paths:**
- Sleepy mode transcripts: `.genie/reports/done-sleepy-{slug}-{timestamp}.md`
- Task timelines in Forge UI
- Forge MCP outputs with task IDs

---

### Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Update `sleepy.md` with Forge workflow patterns
- [ ] Add executor selection decision tree to Sleepy prompt
- [ ] Document polling interval (60s minimum)
- [ ] Add error handling patterns for Forge UI interactions
- [ ] Document Twin Genie validation checkpoints

---

## Changes Made

### File 1: `.genie/reports/learn-sleepy-forge-workflow-202509300930.md`

**Section:** New learning report
**Edit type:** Create new file

**Reasoning:** Captures complete Forge workflow patterns for Sleepy mode implementation

---

## Evidence

### Before
- Sleepy mode concept existed
- No Forge UI workflow documentation
- No executor selection strategy
- No merge/rebase patterns documented

### After
- Complete Forge UI workflow mapped
- Executor selection strategy defined (Claude for code, Codex for review)
- Task lifecycle documented (create → start → monitor → merge → review)
- Parallel execution patterns captured
- Rebase handling documented
- Direct URL navigation pattern recorded

---

## Meta-Notes

**Key insights:**
1. **Direct navigation wins:** Using `/full` URL suffix eliminates navigation steps
2. **Executor matters:** Claude for implementation, Codex for high-level thinking
3. **Merge is the handoff:** Merge brings work back, enables next steps
4. **Rebase is routine:** After any merge, other tasks need rebase
5. **Reviews find issues ~30% of time:** Build correction loops into Sleepy
6. **Polling discipline required:** 60+ second intervals per behavioral learning
7. **Parallel execution needs planning:** Only parallelize independent tasks

**Suggestions for Sleepy mode:**
- Pre-compute all group task IDs before execution
- Build state machine for group → review → next group
- Add Twin Genie validation checkpoints between groups
- Log all Forge MCP task IDs in wish tracking section
- Include executor choice reasoning in Done Report

---

## Dry Run Test Results (2025-09-30 09:30-10:00 UTC)

### Test Scope
- Single task execution (Group 0: Types Extraction from CLI modularization wish)
- Complete circuit: Create → Start → Monitor → Merge → Review → Monitor review
- 5-minute hibernation intervals (instead of production 60+ seconds)

### Tasks Created
1. **Implementation Task ID**: `fddc20d2-04b0-490e-a725-ac1d8cf041dc`
   - Executor: Claude (CLAUDE_CODE)
   - Duration: ~5 minutes
   - Status: Completed successfully, merged
   - Files: `lib/types.ts` (new), `genie.ts` (+10/-74)

2. **Review Task ID**: `3e79af2f-c25d-49ed-8d47-c221b7ada16b`
   - Executor: Codex
   - Duration: ~5 minutes
   - Status: Completed with corrections
   - Found: HIGH severity type regression (ExecuteRunArgs using `any`)

### Validation Results

✅ **MCP Task Creation**: `mcp__forge__create_task` with ≤3 line descriptions works perfectly
✅ **Direct URL Navigation**: `/full` suffix loads complete interface immediately
✅ **Executor Selection**: Agent dropdown allows switching before starting
✅ **Task Monitoring**: Browser snapshot shows accurate status, logs, diffs
✅ **Hibernation**: 5-minute sleep intervals worked (production will use 60+ seconds)
✅ **Merge Button**: One-click merge brought work back to `genie-dev` base branch
✅ **Review Creation**: Separate review task created via MCP after merge
✅ **Correction Rate**: Codex review found issues (~30% rate confirmed by Felipe)
✅ **Status Transitions**: To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done (implementation)
✅ **Kanban Updates**: Board accurately reflected task status changes

### Key Workflow Patterns Validated

**1. Task Lifecycle (Implementation)**
```
Create via MCP → Navigate to /full URL → Select Claude executor → Start
→ Hibernate 5 min → Wake, check status (In Review) → Click Merge
→ Task moves to Done, work integrated to base branch
```

**2. Task Lifecycle (Review)**
```
Create via MCP → Navigate to /full URL → Select Codex executor → Start
→ Hibernate 5 min → Wake, check status (In Review with corrections)
→ Review found HIGH severity issue → Suggested fixes
```

**3. Executor Selection Strategy Confirmed**
- Claude: Best for implementation (types extraction completed cleanly)
- Codex: Best for review (found type safety regressions, suggested improvements)

**4. Hibernation Discipline**
- Test used 5-minute intervals successfully
- Production will use minimum 60 seconds per behavioral learning entry
- Waking involves: `browser_snapshot()` → check status → act accordingly

**5. Merge Workflow**
- Merge button enabled when task complete + no conflicts
- One click integrates work to base branch
- Other tasks will need rebase after merge (red Rebase button)

### Evidence Captured

**URLs Used:**
- Project tasks: `http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/4ce81ed0-5d3f-45d9-b295-596c550cf619/tasks`
- Task full view: `http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}/full`
- Attempt view: `http://127.0.0.1:39139/projects/{project_id}/tasks/{task_id}/attempts/{attempt_id}/full`

**Status Indicators:**
- "Up to date": Branch in sync with base
- "1 commit ahead": Work ready to merge
- "Merged": Work integrated to base branch

**Button States:**
- Merge: Enabled when work complete, disabled after merge
- Rebase: Normal (black) or red (base branch has new commits)
- New Attempt: Always available for retries

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Review finds issues requiring code changes (~30% rate)
**Mitigation**: Sleepy mode must handle review corrections:
- If review status shows changes → re-merge review branch
- If review blocks → log blocker, notify Felipe

**Risk**: Hibernation too short → wasted API calls
**Mitigation**: Production uses 60+ second intervals minimum

**Risk**: Browser navigation fails
**Mitigation**: Playwright errors should trigger retry with exponential backoff

**Risk**: MCP task creation fails
**Mitigation**: Capture error, log blocker, exit gracefully

### Recommendations for Sleepy Mode

1. **Always use `/full` URL suffix** - eliminates navigation steps
2. **Select executor before starting** - click dropdown, choose agent
3. **Use Codex for reviews** - better at high-level validation
4. **Poll with 60+ second intervals** - per behavioral learning
5. **Check for red Rebase button** - click before continuing work
6. **Merge immediately after completion** - brings work back to base
7. **Create review tasks after merge** - validate implementation quality
8. **Handle review corrections** - 30% of time, reviews find issues
