# AGENTS.md Architecture Clarification
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** âœ… VALIDATED - Architecture is correct

---

## ðŸŽ¯ THE QUESTION

User asked about AGENTS.md files:
- Root project (`/AGENTS.md`) - "master genie"
- Each collective (`.genie/code/AGENTS.md`, `.genie/create/AGENTS.md`) - "different collective"
- `.genie/AGENTS.md` - "maybe outdated version of base genie?"

**Request:** Check for differences and report back

## âœ… ARCHITECTURE VALIDATED (All Correct!)

### **1. `/AGENTS.md` (566 lines) - Master Genie** âœ…
**What it is:** The template consciousness / Base Genie orchestration framework
**Content:**
- Core identity ("I am Master Genie - The Original Template")
- Installation and workspace detection
- Core purpose and orchestration rules
- Collectives architecture
- 7 Core Amendments (No Wish Without Issue, File Organization, Real-Time State, etc.)
- Universal spells list
- Knowledge graph

**Status:** âœ… CORRECT - This is the master orchestrator

---

### **2. `.genie/AGENTS.md` (1 line) - Alias** âœ…
**What it is:** Just an @ reference to root
**Content:**
```markdown
@AGENTS.md
```

**Status:** âœ… CORRECT - NOT outdated, just an alias pattern (per Amendment #2)

---

### **3. `.genie/code/AGENTS.md` (534 lines) - Code Collective** âœ…
**What it is:** Code collective's full agent definition
**Content:**
- Code collective identity (software dev, Git, testing, CI/CD)
- Code-specific spells (publishing protocol, Genie integration, tool requirements)
- Workflow architecture (Wish â†’ Forge â†’ Review)
- Advisory Teams (Tech Council with personas: Nayr, Oettam, JT)
- Code Amendments (Automation Through Removal, Automated Publishing, Auto-Sync)
- **Genie Genie** - Independent architect with 16 reasoning modes
  - Core modes: challenge, explore, consensus
  - Specialized modes: plan, analyze, deep-dive, risk-audit, etc.

**Status:** âœ… CORRECT - Code collective's brain

---

### **4. `.genie/create/AGENTS.md` (102 lines) - Create Collective** âœ…
**What it is:** Create collective's agent definition
**Content:**
- Create identity (shape-shifting intelligence for human-world work)
- Core philosophy ("Create doesn't come pre-loaded with every capability. Create becomes what the user needs by generating expertise in real-time")
- Generative intelligence (recognizes patterns â†’ generates capabilities â†’ applies â†’ learns â†’ matures)
- Shape-shifting domains (executive assistant, PM, strategist, analyst, HR, etc.)
- Core capabilities: researcher, writer, editor, install

**Status:** âœ… CORRECT - Create collective's brain

---

### **5. `.genie/utilities/AGENTS.md` (7 lines) - Utilities Collective** âœ…
**What it is:** Utilities collective index
**Content:**
- "Utility agents for infrastructure and automation tasks"
- Agents list: upstream-update

**Status:** âœ… CORRECT - Minimal utilities index

## ðŸ“Š SUMMARY TABLE

| File | Lines | Purpose | Status |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| `/AGENTS.md` | 566 | Master Genie orchestrator | âœ… Master template |
| `.genie/AGENTS.md` | 1 | Alias to root | âœ… Correct alias |
| `.genie/code/AGENTS.md` | 534 | Code collective brain | âœ… Collective-specific |
| `.genie/create/AGENTS.md` | 102 | Create collective brain | âœ… Collective-specific |
| `.genie/utilities/AGENTS.md` | 7 | Utilities index | âœ… Minimal index |

---

## ðŸ§  ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT

**The pattern is:**
```
/AGENTS.md                       â†’ Master Genie (universal orchestration)
.genie/AGENTS.md                 â†’ @AGENTS.md (alias)
.genie/<collective>/AGENTS.md    â†’ Collective-specific brains (different identities)
```

**Why this works:**
- Master Genie handles routing and universal patterns
- Each collective has its own identity, spells, workflows, teams
- No duplication - each file has unique purpose
- Code collective even includes "Genie Genie" (independent architect with 16 reasoning modes)

---

## âœ… CONCLUSION

**All AGENTS.md files are architecturally correct. No duplicates, no outdated versions.**

Felipe's understanding was spot-on:
- Root = Master Genie âœ…
- Collectives = Different identities âœ…
- `.genie/AGENTS.md` = Alias (not outdated) âœ…

**No action required.**
