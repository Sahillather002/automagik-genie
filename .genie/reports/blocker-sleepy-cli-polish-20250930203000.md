# Sleepy Mode Blocker Report

**Wish:** cli-modularization-polish
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T20:30:00Z
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Phase:** group_a_execution

## Blocker Summary

Group A polish agent fails to initialize and stops immediately after launch. Two attempts made:
1. First attempt: 20:18Z - stopped during initialization
2. Second attempt: 20:29Z - stopped during initialization

**Impact:** Autonomous execution blocked. Cannot proceed to Groups B/C without Group A completion.

## Evidence

### Session Status
```
specialists/polish  ðŸ”š stopped  n/a  11m ago (both attempts)
```

### Progress Indicators
- JSDoc count: 0 (expected â‰¥11)
- README Architecture section: not added
- Build status: not checked (no work done)

### Autonomous Monitoring
- Total hibernation cycles: 10
- Sleep duration: 120s per cycle
- Total monitoring time: ~22 minutes
- State file updates: successful (hibernation_count = 10)

## Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis 1:** Polish agent missing or misconfigured
- Check: `./genie run polish --help` or agent definition
- Evidence needed: Agent spec at `.genie/agents/specialists/polish.md`

**Hypothesis 2:** Task file format incompatible
- Check: Task-a.md structure vs expected format
- Evidence: Task file uses @ references and advanced prompting

**Hypothesis 3:** CLI background execution issue
- Check: Session ID capture failing (both showed "n/a")
- Evidence: "Session started but ID not available yet (timeout after 20s)"

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Human)
1. **Verify polish agent exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la .genie/agents/specialists/polish.md
   cat .genie/agents/specialists/polish.md | head -20
   ```

2. **Try direct execution (not background):**
   ```bash
   ./genie run polish "@.genie/wishes/cli-modularization-polish/task-a.md" --foreground
   ```

3. **Fallback: Manual execution:**
   - Execute Group A manually following task-a.md instructions
   - Update state file: `forge_tasks[0].status = "done"`
   - Resume Sleepy Mode to continue with Groups B/C

### Strategic
- If polish agent consistently fails, consider:
  - Using `implementor` agent instead for Group A
  - Breaking Group A into smaller sub-tasks
  - Executing Group A outside Sleepy Mode, then resuming for B/C

## State File

Current state captured at: `.genie/state/sleepy-cli-modularization-polish.json`

```json
{
  "phase": "group_a_execution",
  "forge_tasks": [
    {
      "id": "GROUP-A",
      "status": "pending",  // Still pending after 22min
      "group": "Documentation Polish"
    }
  ],
  "alerts": [
    {
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "Group A polish session stopped during initialization (no ID captured). Restarting with retry.",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-30T20:29:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "hibernation_count": 10
}
```

## Next Steps

**Sleepy Mode paused.** Awaiting human intervention to resolve polish agent blocker.

**Resume command after fix:**
```bash
/sleepy "CONTINUE MONITORING FROM WHERE YOU LEFT OFF"
```

**Completion criteria before resume:**
- Group A work visible (JSDoc count â‰¥11 OR state file manually updated)
- Polish agent functional (or alternative agent chosen)
