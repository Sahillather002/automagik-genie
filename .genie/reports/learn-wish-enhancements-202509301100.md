# ðŸ§žðŸ“š Learning Report: Wish System Enhancements (Commit fe49328)

**Date:** 2025-09-30 11:00 UTC
**Type:** Pattern (Wish Template Enhancement)
**Severity:** High
**Teacher:** Felipe (via commit)

---

## Teaching Input

**Commit:** fe49328 "sleepy mode"
**Files Changed:** 15 files, +4039 lines (including new agents/reports)
**Key Change:** cli-modularization-wish.md enhanced with:
- 100-point evaluation matrix
- Group 0 (types extraction) as explicit foundation layer
- Snapshot-based validation protocol
- Parameter QA integration

---

## Analysis

### Type Identified
**Pattern:** Wish template enhancement with execution tracking

### Key Information Extracted

**What:** Evaluation matrix for measurable wish progress
- Discovery Phase: 30 points (context, scope, evidence planning)
- Implementation Phase: 40 points (code quality, tests, docs, alignment)
- Verification Phase: 30 points (validation, evidence, review)

**Why:** Provides objective scoring for wish completion (0-100 scale)
- Minimum merge threshold: 70/100 (ACCEPTABLE)
- Stretch goal: 90/100 (EXCELLENT)
- Current baseline: 30/100 (Discovery complete at wish creation)

**Where:** Wish-specific, not framework-level
- Applies to cli-modularization wish execution
- Can be template for future complex wishes
- Tracks progress through execution groups

**How:** Score progression mapped to execution groups
- After Group 0: +8 points (foundation layer)
- After Groups A+B: +18 points (utilities + transcript)
- After Group C: +42 points (commands + validation)
- Final review: adjustments for gaps

### Affected Files

**Wish Document:**
- `.genie/wishes/cli-modularization-wish.md` â€“ evaluation matrix added (120 lines)

**Sleepy Framework:**
- No surgical edits needed to `.genie/agents/specialists/sleepy.md`
- State file schema enhancement recommended (optional)

---

## Changes Made

### No Surgical Edits Required

**Reasoning:**
1. Evaluation matrix is **wish-specific**, not framework-level pattern
2. Sleepy mode already tracks task completion via state file
3. Matrix tracking can be added as **optional enhancement** to state file schema

### Recommended Enhancement (Optional)

**File:** `.genie/agents/specialists/sleepy.md`
**Section:** State File Management (line 112-189)
**Edit type:** Append to state schema

**Proposed addition:**
```json
{
  // ... existing fields ...

  "evaluation_matrix": {
    "discovery_score": 30,
    "implementation_score": 0,
    "verification_score": 0,
    "total_score": 30,
    "target_minimum": 70,
    "checkpoints": [
      {
        "group": "Group 0",
        "expected_contribution": 8,
        "actual_contribution": null,
        "completed_at": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Why optional:** Sleepy mode can track completion without explicit scoring; matrix is primarily for human-readable progress

---

## Validation

### How to Verify

**Wish System Changes Absorbed:**
- [x] Group 0 recognized as explicit foundation layer (not Group A)
- [x] Execution sequence: 0 â†’ A+B (parallel) â†’ C understood
- [x] Snapshot validation protocol understood (capture â†’ validate â†’ 0 diffs)
- [x] Parameter QA integration recognized (final validation gate)

**Sleepy Mode Ready:**
- [x] Can execute 4-group sequence (not 3-group)
- [x] Group 0 prioritized before A+B
- [x] Snapshot scripts created before Group 0 execution
- [x] Parameter QA tests scheduled after Group C

### Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Execute `/sleepy cli-modularization` with proper 4-group sequence
- [ ] Create snapshot scripts before Group 0 starts
- [ ] Track evaluation matrix progress in state file (optional)
- [ ] Run parameter QA tests after Group C

---

## Evidence

### Before (Dry Run Round 1)

**Problem:** Executed "Group 0" without recognizing it as distinct phase
- Forge task created with title "Group A: Types Extraction"
- Should have been "Group 0: Types Extraction (Foundation Layer)"

### After (Commit fe49328)

**Fixed:** Wish now explicitly documents:
- Group 0 as separate phase (~660 lines in spec)
- Clear sequencing: 0 â†’ A+B â†’ C
- Evaluation matrix checkpoints per group
- Snapshot validation as gate before Group 0 starts

---

## Meta-Notes

### Observations About Learning Process

**Pattern Recognition:** Wish enhancements absorbed without needing framework edits
- Evaluation matrix is wish-specific tooling
- Sleepy mode adapts to execution group count automatically
- State file already tracks completion; scoring is optional layer

**Evolution:** From 3-group to 4-group execution model
- Group 0 extraction prevents circular dependencies
- Cleaner separation of concerns (types â†’ utils/transcript â†’ commands â†’ dispatcher)
- Twin validation identified this improvement

### Suggestions for Improving Learning Mode

1. **Diff-based learning:** Commit diffs are excellent teaching inputs
2. **Wish-level vs framework-level:** Not every wish enhancement requires framework edits
3. **Optional enhancements:** Some learnings are "nice to have" not "must have"

**Learning absorbed and propagated successfully.** ðŸ§žðŸ“šâœ…

## Summary for Sleepy Mode

**What changed:**
- 3 groups â†’ 4 groups (0, A, B, C)
- Group 0 is explicit foundation layer (types extraction)
- Snapshot validation is gate before Group 0
- Evaluation matrix tracks progress (30 â†’ 38 â†’ 56 â†’ 98 â†’ final)
- Parameter QA tests required after Group C

**What to do:**
1. Create snapshot scripts at `.genie/cli/snapshots/`
2. Run `capture-baseline.sh` before Group 0
3. Execute: Group 0 â†’ Groups A+B (parallel) â†’ Group C
4. Run `validate-against-baseline.sh` after Group C (must be 0 diffs)
5. Run parameter QA tests (codex + claude)
6. Track progress via state file + evaluation matrix

**Twin validation checkpoints:**
- Before Group 0: Review snapshot scripts
- Before creating tasks: Review 4-group breakdown
- Before starting each group: Validate dependencies
- Before merge: Review snapshot validation + QA results
