# Behavioral Correction: Learning Mode Entry Protocol

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Violation:** Failed to follow meta-learn.md protocol on "enter learning mode" trigger
**Session:** User said "enter learning mode", Base Genie responded conversationally vs loading protocol

## What Happened
- User: "enter learning mode"
- Expected: Load meta-learn.md → Signal readiness → Stand by
- Actual: Conversational response asking what to learn

## Root Cause
Did not recognize "enter learning mode" as protocol trigger per meta-learn.md:21-26, 49-53

## Correction Applied
✅ Loaded meta-learn.md
✅ Following protocol: Signal readiness, stand by for teaching
✅ Protocol already documented (no file updates needed)

## Evidence
- Protocol exists: `.genie/spells/meta-learn.md:49-53`
- Natural language intent recognition: Lines 21-26
- This is behavioral adherence issue, not missing documentation

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED** - Following existing protocol, standing by for teaching
