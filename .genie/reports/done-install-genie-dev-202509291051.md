# âœ… Genie Install / Self-Calibration Report

## Scope
- Branch: `genie-dev`
- Mode: Codebase analysis with meta-agent customization (manual execution of install agent duties)
- Objective: Recast product docs to describe Genie Dev as the self-improvement lane and document required configuration

## Files Updated
- `.genie/product/mission.md`
- `.genie/product/mission-lite.md`
- `.genie/product/tech-stack.md`
- `.genie/product/roadmap.md`
- `.genie/product/environment.md`

## Evidence & Commands
- Validated absence of template placeholders via `rg '\\{\\{' .genie/product`
- No build or smoke commands executed (docs-only change)

## Risks & Notes
- Downstream wishes should reference the refreshed roadmap phases before scheduling new work
- Environment guidance now assumes GPT-5 availability; adjust `GENIE_MODEL` per provider if different
- Recommend running `pnpm run test:genie` after any accompanying CLI changes land

## Next Actions
- Phase 1 instrumentation work: add wish templates for telemetry expansion
- Prepare twin audit prompt focusing on roadmap risks before first self-improvement wish

## Status
Ready for `/plan` to draft the first genie-dev self-improvement wish.
