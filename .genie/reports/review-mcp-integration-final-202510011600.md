# MCP Integration - Final Review Report

**Date:** 2025-10-01 16:00Z
**Reviewer:** review subagent (evidence-based validation)
**Wish:** @.genie/wishes/mcp-integration-wish.md
**Forge Plan:** @.genie/state/reports/forge-plan-mcp-integration-202510011340.md
**Status:** ❌ INCOMPLETE - Critical gaps identified

---

## Executive Summary

**VERDICT:** ❌ **BLOCK MERGE** - Wish claims 100/100 completion but evidence reveals **59/100 actual score**.

### Critical Findings

1. **Build Broken:** TypeScript compilation fails with 17+ errors
2. **Tests Non-Functional:** `pnpm run test:all` fails due to build errors
3. **Evidence Gaps:** 0/6 MCP Inspector screenshots, 0 performance benchmarks
4. **Tool Coverage:** Only 2/6 tools tested (list_agents, list_sessions)
5. **False Completion Claims:** Multiple review reports claimed 85-100/100 without validation

### Score Breakdown

| Phase | Target | Actual | Gap |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| **Discovery** | 30 pts | 30 pts | ✅ 0 |
| **Implementation** | 40 pts | 22 pts | ❌ -18 |
| **Verification** | 30 pts | 7 pts | ❌ -23 |
| **TOTAL** | 100 pts | **59 pts** | ❌ **-41** |

---

## Evidence-Based Validation

### 1. Build Status ❌ FAILING

**Command:** `pnpm run build:mcp`

**Result:** ✅ PASSES (after `pnpm install`)

**Command:** `pnpm run test:all`

**Result:** ❌ FAILS with TypeScript errors

```
.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/list.ts(6,3): error TS2322
.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/resume.ts(69,30): error TS2339
.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/stop.ts(7,3): error TS2322
.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/view.ts(7,3): error TS2322
... (17+ errors total)
```

**Impact:**
- CLI build fails, preventing `./genie` usage
- Handler integration incomplete (Group A blocker)
- Tests cannot run without successful build

**Evidence:** Command output captured above

---

### 2. Test Coverage ❌ INCOMPLETE

**Automated Tests:** `tests/mcp-automated.test.js`

**Result:** ✅ 30/30 assertions PASS (MCP server only)

**Coverage:**
- ✅ MCP protocol handshake
- ✅ Tools discovery (6 tools)
- ✅ Tool schema validation
- ✅ list_agents execution
- ✅ list_sessions execution
- ❌ run tool NOT tested (stub only)
- ❌ resume tool NOT tested (stub only)
- ❌ view tool NOT tested (stub only)
- ❌ stop tool NOT tested (stub only)

**Gap:** Only 2/6 tools actually tested. Other 4 are stubs returning placeholder messages.

**Evidence:** Test execution output shows:
```
[Test 17-19] list_agents Tool Execution
✅ PASS: list_agents executed

[Test 20-22] list_sessions Tool Execution
✅ PASS: list_sessions executed

No tests for: run, resume, view, stop (stubs only)
```

---

### 3. Evidence Artifacts ❌ MISSING

**Required per Evidence Checklist:**

#### MCP Inspector Screenshots (0/6 captured)
- [ ] All 6 tools listed
- [ ] Tool detail view (schema)
- [ ] Tool execution result
- [ ] Session list after execution
- [ ] Server status
- [ ] Error handling

**Search Result:**
```bash
$ find .genie/wishes/mcp-integration -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg"
(no results)
```

**Impact:** No visual proof of MCP Inspector validation

---

#### Performance Benchmarks (0 documented)
- [ ] list_agents latency
- [ ] list_sessions latency
- [ ] run/resume/view/stop latency
- [ ] Validation: <500ms for list operations

**Search Result:** No benchmark files found in evidence folder

**Impact:** No performance validation against <500ms target

---

### 4. Handler Integration ❌ INCOMPLETE

**Group A Target:** Extract handlers from genie.ts → cli-core/handlers/

**Status:** Handlers created but NOT integrated

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/run.ts`
- ✅ `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/resume.ts`
- ✅ `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/view.ts`
- ✅ `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/stop.ts`
- ✅ `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/list.ts`

**Integration Status:** ❌ NOT CONNECTED

**Evidence:** TypeScript errors show handler type mismatches:
```
error TS2322: Type '(parsed: ParsedCommand) => Promise<{...}>' is not assignable to type 'Handler'.
  Type 'Promise<{...}>' is not assignable to type 'Promise<void>'.
```

**Root Cause:** Handler signature mismatch
- CLI handlers: `Promise<void>` (side-effect based)
- MCP tools: `Promise<ResultData>` (pure functions)

**Workaround:** MCP tools use shell-out pattern (spawn CLI subprocess)

**Score Impact:** 10/20 pts (workaround functional but not production architecture)

---

### 5. npm Package ✅ COMPLETE

**Group B Target:** Publishable `automagik-genie` package with `genie` command

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (20/20 pts)

**Validation:**
```bash
$ genie --help
Commands:
  run [options] <agent> <prompt>
  resume <sessionId> <prompt>
  list <type>
  view [options] <sessionId>
  stop <sessionId>
  mcp [options]                   Start MCP server ✅

$ genie mcp --help
Options:
  -t, --transport <type>  Transport type: stdio, sse, http
  -p, --port <port>       Port for HTTP/SSE transport (default: "8080")

$ genie mcp -t stdio
✅ Server started successfully (stdio)
```

**Evidence:** Commands executed successfully, global `genie` command working

---

### 6. Documentation ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `.genie/mcp/README.md` (300+ lines, comprehensive)
- ✅ `.genie/product/tech-stack.md` (MCP section complete)
- ✅ Claude Desktop config examples
- ✅ Manual validation checklist

**Gap:** No inline comments in complex handler code

**Score Impact:** 5/5 pts (external docs complete, inline comments optional)

- [ ] CLI/MCP behavioral equivalence validation
- [ ] Integration tests (CLI creates session → MCP lists it)

**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours

---

#### 2. Complete Testing (10 pts missing)

**Required Work:**
- [ ] Test run tool execution (create session via MCP)
- [ ] Test resume tool execution (continue session via MCP)
- [ ] Test view tool execution (show transcript via MCP)
- [ ] Test stop tool execution (terminate session via MCP)
- [ ] CLI/MCP session consistency tests
- [ ] Error handling tests

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

#### 3. Evidence Artifacts (8 pts missing)

**Required Work:**
- [ ] 6 MCP Inspector screenshots
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (<500ms validation)
- [ ] Before/after comparisons
- [ ] Visual proof of integration

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

#### 4. Build Fixes (5 pts missing)

**Required Work:**
- [ ] Fix TypeScript errors in cli-core handlers
- [ ] Ensure `pnpm run test:all` passes
- [ ] Fix handler type signatures

**Estimated Effort:** 2-4 hours

---

## Blockers

### BLOCKER #1: Build Failure (CRITICAL)
**Issue:** CLI build fails with 17+ TypeScript errors
**Impact:** Tests cannot run, `./genie` command broken
**Location:** `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/*.ts`
**Root Cause:** Handler type signature mismatch (Promise<void> vs Promise<ResultData>)

**Resolution Options:**
1. **Option 1 (Quick Fix):** Accept shell-out workaround, fix type errors separately
2. **Option 2 (Production):** Refactor to data/view separation (4-8 hours)
3. **Option 3 (Hybrid):** Fix type errors, keep workaround, document limitations

**Recommendation:** Option 1 for MVP, Option 2 for v0.2.0

---

### BLOCKER #2: Incomplete Tool Testing (HIGH)
**Issue:** 4/6 tools are stubs, not tested
**Impact:** Cannot validate full MCP integration
**Evidence:** Only list_agents and list_sessions tested in automated suite

**Resolution:**
- Add integration tests for run, resume, view, stop
- Validate CLI/MCP session state consistency
- Test full conversation workflow

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### BLOCKER #3: Missing Evidence (MEDIUM)
**Issue:** 0/6 screenshots, 0 benchmarks
**Impact:** No visual proof of MCP Inspector validation

**Resolution:**
- Run MCP Inspector manually
- Capture 6 screenshots per checklist
- Document performance benchmarks
- Save to `.genie/wishes/mcp-integration/evidence/screenshots/`

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
