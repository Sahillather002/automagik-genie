# Learn Evidence Report: Natural Language Intent Recognition
**Date:** 2025-10-23 07:07 UTC
**Commit:** 4c1d78e9
**Agent:** learn
**Type:** Behavioral Correction

---
version: 1.0.0

## 🎯 Teaching Context

**User feedback:**
"You are the learn agent. Critical behavioral correction needed."

**Core teaching:**
> "I'm your human interface. Understand human language naturally."
>
> "Anything that resembles 'I want you to load the meta-learning skill' should trigger it."

**Problem identified:**
Base Genie was waiting for exact phrase matches instead of understanding natural language intent.

## 🔧 What Changed

**File:** `.genie/skills/meta-learn.md`

### Before (Rigid Phrase Matching)
```markdown
**Protocol Triggers (Immediate Action):**
- "Enter learning mode" → Load meta-learn.md, signal readiness, stand by for teaching
- "Learning mode" / "Learn mode" → Same as above
- "/learn" command → Direct invocation with teaching context

**Explicit Teaching Signals:**
- "Let me teach you..." / "I'm going to teach you..."
- "Here's a new pattern..." / "New framework..."
...
```

### After (Natural Language Intent Recognition)
```markdown
🔴 **CRITICAL: Natural Language Intent Recognition**

**DO NOT wait for exact phrase matches. Understand human language intent naturally.**

Base Genie is the human interface. Recognition means understanding what the user MEANS, not matching exact phrases.

**Protocol Triggers (Natural Language Intent Recognition):**

**Intent: User wants to teach/learn something**
- Examples: "Enter learning mode", "Let's learn", "I want to teach you", "Time to learn", "Load the learning skill", "Learning mode", "/learn"
- Recognition method: ANY natural language expression indicating learning/teaching intent
- Response: Load meta-learn.md, signal readiness, stand by for teaching
...
```

### Anti-Patterns Added
```markdown
**Anti-Pattern:**
- ❌ Waiting for exact phrase match instead of understanding natural language intent
...
- ❌ Requiring user to say exact trigger phrases when their intent is clear
```

## 📊 Impact Analysis

**Scope:**
- Base Genie's recognition patterns for learning mode
- All teaching/correction interactions
- Intent-based protocol triggering

**Behavioral Change:**
1. **Old behavior:** Wait for exact phrases like "Enter learning mode"
2. **New behavior:** Understand ANY natural language expressing learning/teaching intent
3. **Result:** More natural, friction-free human-AI interaction

**Examples Now Recognized:**
- ✅ "Enter learning mode"
- ✅ "Let's learn"
- ✅ "I want to teach you"
- ✅ "Time to learn"
- ✅ "Load the learning skill"
- ✅ "I want you to load the meta-learning skill"
- ✅ ANY expression indicating learning/teaching intent

---

## 🧪 Validation

**How to test:**
1. Try various natural language expressions indicating learning intent
2. Base Genie should recognize intent and invoke learn agent
3. No exact phrase matching required

**Expected behavior:**
- User says anything resembling "I want to teach you" → Learn agent invoked
- User says anything resembling "Let's learn" → Learn agent invoked
- User says anything resembling "Load learning skill" → Learn agent invoked

**Success criteria:**
- Zero friction in triggering learning mode
- Natural language understanding over rigid matching
- Base Genie acts as true human interface

---

## 📝 Core Principle Established

**Base Genie = Human Interface**

This means:
1. Understand what humans MEAN, not exact words they use
2. Intent recognition over phrase matching
3. Natural language understanding is the default
4. Exact phrases are examples, not requirements

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces cognitive load on user (don't need to memorize exact phrases)
- More natural interaction flow
- Base Genie truly becomes conversational interface
- Aligns with "I'm your human interface" identity

## 🔗 Related Patterns

**Intent recognition should apply to:**
- Learning mode triggers (✅ FIXED)
- Skill invocations (review other skills for similar issues)
- Agent delegation (understand "I want you to do X" naturally)
- Protocol triggers (any protocol activation)

**Future opportunity:**
Audit all skills for rigid phrase matching. Replace with intent recognition patterns.

## 🎓 Key Learning

**"I'm your human interface. Understand human language naturally."**

This is not just about learning mode triggers. This is a fundamental principle for ALL Base Genie interactions:

1. **Intent over syntax**
2. **Meaning over exact words**
3. **Natural language understanding as default**
4. **Examples illustrate, don't constrain**

Applied effective immediately. Future interactions should demonstrate natural language understanding across all protocols.
