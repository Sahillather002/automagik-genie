# ✅ Done Report — Wish Evidence Checklist Enablement

## Scope
- Implemented Group A from `@.genie/wishes/genie-dev-instrumentation-phase1-wish.md`: add evidence checklist requirements ahead of Phase 1 instrumentation.

## Changes
- Updated `@.genie/agents/wish.md` with a `### Evidence Checklist` section prompting validation commands, artefact paths, and approval checkpoints.
- Strengthened orchestration guardrails in `@AGENTS.md` to require completion of the checklist before implementation.
- Flagged the checklist as the gating deliverable for Phase 1 in `@.genie/product/roadmap.md`.
- Added commit-agent reminder in `@.genie/agents/utilities/commit.md` so specialists verify the checklist before releasing work.

## Validation
- Manual review only (docs update). Tests deferred until CLI diagnostics upgrades land as noted in the wish.

## Next Steps
- When implementation work begins, fill the Evidence Checklist in each new wish and log chosen validation commands + artefact paths in the wish status log.
- Schedule twin audit for roadmap risks when additional instrumentation items queue up.

## Status
Ready for `/forge` follow-up or specialist execution.
