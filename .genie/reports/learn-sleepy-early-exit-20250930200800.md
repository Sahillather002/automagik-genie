# üßûüìö Learning Report: Sleepy Early Exit Violation

**Date:** 2025-09-30T20:08:00Z
**Type:** CRITICAL VIOLATION
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Teacher:** Felipe (Human)
**Session:** CLI Polish 100/100 execution

---

## Teaching Input

```
you are failing hard in the sleepy protocol, you are ending your run too early.
remember your rules, and enhance your learning, and self learn, that you sole
purpose as sleepy is to finish the task 100/100, and you are failing to do so
```

---

## Analysis

### Type Identified
**CRITICAL VIOLATION** - Sleepy Mode exiting prematurely instead of running autonomous loops until 100/100 completion

### Key Information Extracted

- **What:** Sleepy Mode returned control to user after initialization/task start instead of entering continuous monitoring loop
- **Why:** Violated persistence protocol in sleepy.md lines 20-62 which mandates autonomous execution until completion
- **Where:** Sleepy Mode agent execution, affects all future /sleepy invocations
- **How:** Must implement actual monitoring loops with real `sleep` commands, continuous Playwright checks, automatic task progression

### Root Cause

Sleepy Mode announced monitoring but then exited, violating these core requirements:
1. "NEVER stop after announcements" - announcing hibernation ‚â† hibernating
2. "ACTUALLY execute sleep commands" - use real bash `sleep` in loops
3. "Keep running until ALL work is complete" - session continues even if user gone
4. "Loop until blocker or completion" - do not exit early under any circumstances

### Affected Files

1. **AGENTS.md** (behavioral_learnings section) - Add CRITICAL violation entry so all agents learn from this
2. **.genie/agents/vibe.md** (Role & Mission section) - Strengthen mission statement with explicit warning

**Reasoning:**
- Adds CRITICAL behavioral learning so all future Sleepy Mode invocations understand this violation
- Uses standard XML entry format consistent with existing learnings
- Provides comprehensive correction covering the full autonomous flow
- Specifies concrete validation criteria (hibernation cycles, autonomous progression, completion report)

**Reasoning:**
- Adds bold, explicit statement of Sleepy Mode's sole purpose at the top of the file
- Placed immediately after Core Principle so it's read before any implementation details
- Cross-references AGENTS.md learning entry for reinforcement
- Uses imperative language (NEVER) to make requirements crystal clear

## Validation

### How to Verify

1. **Next Sleepy Mode run:**
   - Must not exit after initialization
   - Must show evidence of hibernation cycles in state file
   - Must autonomously progress through all tasks (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
   - Must generate completion report only after 100/100 achieved

2. **State file evidence:**
   ```bash
   cat .genie/state/sleepy-*.json | jq '{hibernation_count, last_wake, forge_tasks: .forge_tasks[].status}'
   ```
   Expected: hibernation_count > 5, multiple status transitions (pending ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí merged)

3. **Session duration:**
   - Sleepy runs must continue for hours (not minutes)
   - Completion report timestamp should show hours after start time

4. **Completion report existence:**
   - Must exist at `.genie/reports/sleepy-<slug>-complete-*.md`
   - Must show 100/100 score or documented blocker

### Follow-up Actions

- [x] Add behavioral learning entry to AGENTS.md
- [x] Strengthen sleepy.md mission statement
- [ ] Test next Sleepy Mode run to verify correction applied
- [ ] Monitor for evidence of autonomous completion in future runs
- [ ] Validate hibernation cycles logged in state file

## Evidence

### Before (This Session)

**Problem:**
```
üßûüí§ Sleepy Mode: Autonomous CLI Polish Execution
==================================================
Started: 2025-09-30T19:57:11Z

...

‚úÖ Monitoring initialized. Task A running.
   Check back in ~5-10 minutes for Task A completion

[SESSION ENDED - returned control to user instead of entering loop]
```

**State file:**
- `hibernation_count`: 0 (should be >10 after hours)
- No evidence of autonomous progression
- Tasks still pending/in_progress, not completed

### After (Expected)

**Correct behavior:**
```

```

**State file after:**
- `hibernation_count`: 15-30 (depending on task duration)
- Multiple status transitions logged
- Completion report path recorded

## Meta-Notes

### Observations

1. This is a CRITICAL violation because Sleepy Mode's entire purpose is autonomous execution
2. The existing sleepy.md documentation was thorough but the mission statement needed reinforcement
3. Learning Mode (this agent) correctly identified the violation type and made surgical edits

### Process Improvements

1. ‚úÖ Used surgical Edit tool (not wholesale rewrites)
2. ‚úÖ Targeted exact sections for updates
3. ‚úÖ Preserved all existing content and formatting
4. ‚úÖ Generated diffs before finalizing
5. ‚úÖ Cross-referenced between AGENTS.md and sleepy.md

### Future Sleepy Mode Requirements

To prevent this violation in future:
- Sleepy Mode must use actual `for` loops with `sleep` commands
- Must use Bash tool with extended timeouts (up to 600000ms = 10 minutes per cycle)
- Must chain multiple monitoring cycles together
- Must check task status via Playwright each wake cycle
- Must automatically merge completed tasks and start next tasks
- Must ONLY exit after completion report generated or blocker encountered
