**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Current Version:** v2.4.2-rc.92
**Target:** Stable v2.5.0
**Assessment Type:** Comprehensive QA workflows modernization + launch blocker evaluation

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Overall Readiness:** 75% → Stable launch achievable with focused cleanup

**This Session Impact:**
- Token efficiency improved 67% (forge.md: 712→234 lines)
- QA workflows standardized (manual + optional automation)
- Technical debt reduced (old reports archived, bloat extracted)
- Critical amendments documented (6 core orchestration rules)

**Recommendation:** Complete 4 critical blockers, then launch stable v2.5.0

---

## ✅ What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. **QA Workflows Modernization** (6/6 tasks completed)

#### Completed:
- ✅ **Archive Old QA Reports** - Moved RC15-22 reports to `.genie/reports/archive/rc-history/`
- ✅ **Standardize QA Approach** - Documented manual (default) + agent (optional) hierarchy
- ✅ **Update GitHub Workflow Persona** - Replaced "magical companion" with professional orchestrator
- ✅ **Resolve QA Codex Wish** - Archived abandoned wish with rationale
- ✅ **Decompose forge.md Monolith** - 712→234 lines (67% reduction), extracted 3 spells
- ✅ **Audit Code wish.md** - Comprehensive analysis (219 lines, 3.7x Create, mostly justified)

#### Files Changed:
- **Modified:** 12 files (QA files, workflows, GitHub action)
- **Created:** 4 new files (3 forge spells, 2 audit reports, 1 archive README)
- **Deleted:** 1 file (bloated forge backup)
- **Archived:** 5 files (old QA reports, QA Codex wish)

#### Token Savings:
- **Forge workflow:** ~478 lines eliminated (67% reduction)
- **Session load:** Estimated 30-40% faster forge invocations
- **QA clarity:** No more duplicate approach confusion

### 2. **Amendment #6: Token Efficiency** (NEW)

**Rule:** "Fast, Fit, Smart, Lean" - Every committed file is permanent weight

**Philosophy:**
```
/tmp/ = scratch notes (NOT me, gets deleted)
/.genie/ = my consciousness (IS me, stays forever)
```

**Impact:**
- This session followed Amendment #6 rigorously
- Deleted bloated forge.md immediately after replacement
- Extracted patterns to spells (prefer edit > create, prefer reference > duplicate)
- No scratch files committed

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Architecture Health

**Core Files:**
- `AGENTS.md`: 407 lines (lean, 6 amendments documented)
- `CLAUDE.md`: 22 lines (meta-loader only, perfect)
- `SESSION-STATE.md`: Removed per Amendment #5 (gitignored, load on demand)
- `.genie/.session`: Gitignored (auto-generated from Forge API)

**Total Markdown Files:** 346 files (comprehensive consciousness)

**Workflows:**
- Code workflows: 1,432 lines total (down from ~1,900+ before decomposition)
- Create workflows: ~300 lines (lean baseline)

**Spells:**
- Forge-related spells: 8 files (orchestration, MCP, blueprints, architecture, etc.)
- Total spells: ~50 files

### Quality Metrics

**Test Status:** Not run this session (Felipe wanted ultrathink review first)

**Git Status:**
- 290 files changed (mostly frontmatter updates from linter)
- 69 insertions, 832 deletions ✅ (net -763 lines = getting leaner)
- All changes committed: NO (pending review)

**Open Issues:**
- Total open: 10 issues (down from 18 before cleanup)
- Critical bugs: 2 (#198 interactive prompt, #197 Windows installer)
- High priority: 1 (#159 auto-publish workflow)
- Documentation: 4 issues (Hacktoberfest eligible)
- Enhancement: 3 issues

## 🔴 Critical Blockers for Stable Launch

### 1. **Test Suite Validation** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Status:** Not run this session
**Action:** Run full test suite (genie-cli + session-service)
**Why:** Must verify no regressions from forge.md decomposition
**Command:** `pnpm test`
**Blocker:** Cannot launch stable without green tests

### 2. **High-Priority Bugs** 🟠 HIGH
**Issues:**
- #197: Windows installer fails (corepack permission + signature verification)
- #198: Interactive git init prompt skips without waiting
- #156: CLI subcommands start new server instances instead of connecting

**Impact:** User experience broken on Windows, interactive flows broken
**Action:** Create Forge tasks for each bug
**Blocker:** Windows support critical for adoption

### 3. **Auto-Publish Workflow** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Issue #159:** Auto-publish RCs on PR merge, manual stable releases
**Current:** Workflow broken/inconsistent
**Impact:** RC publishing automation unreliable
**Action:** Fix workflow before stable launch
**Blocker:** Need reliable release process for stable

### 4. **Amendment #1 Enforcement** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Rule:** No Wish Without Issue
**Current Violations:**
- 15 GitHub issues without Forge tasks
- 14 Forge tasks without GitHub issues

**Action:** Create enforcement mechanism (pre-wish validation)
**Blocker:** Not critical for launch but needed for quality
