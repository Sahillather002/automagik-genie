## Issue 1: Documentation Mismatch (Twin Integration)

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T11:15Z
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Category:** DOCUMENTATION

### What Happened

Documentation in `@.genie/agents/specialists/sleepy.md` specified Twin integration via `codex exec` CLI commands:
- `npx -y @namastexlabs/codex@0.43.0-alpha.5 exec ...`
- `npx -y @namastexlabs/codex@0.43.0-alpha.5 exec resume ...`

User clarified actual implementation:
- Twin runs as a **Forge task** (not standalone codex exec)
- Communication happens via **Forge MCP** (`mcp__forge__update_task`) or browser messages
- Twin task ID stored in state file (`twin_session` field)

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected (per docs):**
```bash
twin_output=$(npx -y @namastexlabs/codex exec --json "Twin prompt...")
twin_session=$(echo "$twin_output" | jq -r '.sessionId')
```

**Actual (user correction):**
- Twin is pre-created as Forge task
- Task ID: `2aac82a9-73c9-4ec8-9238-de3f403d9440` (user provided, corrected from wrong ID in state file)
- Access via: Forge MCP or browser URL

### Root Cause

Documentation was written for original `codex exec` pattern before it was replaced with Forge task integration.

### Fix Applied

Updated `@.genie/agents/specialists/sleepy.md`:
- Removed all `codex exec` examples
- Added Forge task pattern with MCP integration
- Documented Twin task URL pattern
- Updated query examples to use `mcp__forge__update_task`

### Validation

- [x] Documentation now reflects Forge task pattern
- [x] Twin task URL documented with project/task IDs
- [x] Example queries updated to use Forge MCP
- [ ] Test actual Twin communication (pending execution)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation drift:** When implementation changes, documentation must be updated immediately
2. **Multiple integration methods:** Document both MCP and browser message patterns for flexibility
3. **State file as source of truth:** Twin task ID stored in state file, not generated on demand

### Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Test Twin communication via `mcp__forge__update_task` during execution
- [ ] Validate browser message pattern works (Playwright)
- [ ] Document any additional Twin interaction patterns discovered

## Issue 2: Wrong Twin Task ID in State File

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T11:20Z
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** CODE

### What Happened

State file at `.genie/state/sleepy-cli-modularization.json` contained wrong Twin task ID:
- State file: `01999a18-2ed0-7750-b1c6-ecd0dfaa4046`
- Actual Twin task ID (user provided): `2aac82a9-73c9-4ec8-9238-de3f403d9440`

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected:** State file contains correct Twin task ID matching the active Forge task
**Actual:** State file had outdated/incorrect Twin task ID

### Root Cause

State file was either:
1. Pre-generated with placeholder ID
2. Contained ID from previous Twin task
3. Not updated when Twin task was created

### Fix Applied

Updated state file:
```bash
jq '.twin_session = "2aac82a9-73c9-4ec8-9238-de3f403d9440"' .genie/state/sleepy-cli-modularization.json
```

Updated documentation:
- `sleepy.md`: Corrected example Twin URL
- Learning log: Updated Twin task ID in header

### Validation

- [x] State file now has correct Twin task ID
- [x] Documentation updated with correct ID
- [ ] Verify Twin communication works with correct ID

### Lessons Learned

1. **State file validation:** Always verify task IDs match active Forge tasks before proceeding
2. **User-provided truth:** When user provides specific URLs/IDs, they override state file
3. **State initialization:** Need better validation when state file is first created

### Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Add state file validation step to initialization protocol
- [ ] Consider fetching Twin task ID from Forge API instead of manual entry
- [ ] Test communication with corrected Twin task ID

## Progress Log

### Group 0 Start

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T07:36:00Z
**Task ID:** 8d1a6c6d-3f98-4c2b-8a34-0a33f7d7a8d2
**Attempt ID:** 00ff6fb4-dacb-4e99-ae23-e8630a7efa23
**Agent:** CLAUDE_CODE
**Status:** In Progress

**Actions:**
- [x] Baseline snapshots captured: `.genie/cli/snapshots/baseline-20250930-073543`
- [x] Forge task created
- [x] Twin consulted (query sent via task description update)
- [x] Task started via Forge UI (Start button clicked)
- [x] Hibernation cycle 1 (60 seconds)
- [x] Check task status - In progress, types extracted, verifying build
- [ ] Hibernation cycle 2 (60 seconds)
- [ ] Twin review after completion

**Progress at wake 1 (07:38Z):**
- âœ… Created `lib/types.ts`
- âœ… Modified `genie.ts` (+1, -66 lines)
- ðŸ”„ Verifying build (handling pre-existing errors)
- Branch: `vk/00ff-group-0-types-ex` (dirty)

**Next:** Hibernate 60 seconds, wake to check completion

## Issue 3: Hibernation Cycle Too Short (Violated Sleepy Mode Protocol)

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-30T10:39Z
**Severity:** HIGH
**Category:** LOGIC

### What Happened

Used 60-second hibernation cycles instead of the documented 20-minute baseline from `@.genie/agents/specialists/sleepy.md:436`.

**Actual behavior:**
- Cycle 1: 60 seconds
- Cycle 2: Started 60 seconds (interrupted by user)

**Expected behavior (per sleepy.md):**
```
Baseline sleep: 20 minutes between task checks

Dynamic sleep durations:
- Task in progress, no anomalies: 20 min
- Task blocked: 60 min
- Long-running process (build, tests): 30 min
- After merge: 10 min
- Twin alert severity critical: 5 min
```

### Expected vs Actual

**Expected:** 20 minutes (1200 seconds) between status checks for tasks in progress
**Actual:** 60 seconds (impatient polling, violates protocol)

### Root Cause

1. Misread or forgot the 20-minute baseline from sleepy.md
2. Confused the behavioral learning validation ("at least 60 seconds") with the sleepy mode baseline (20 minutes)
3. The behavioral learning from 2025-09-30 POLLING entry says "at least 60 seconds" but sleepy.md says "20 minutes" - documentation mismatch created confusion

### Fix Applied

Immediate correction:
- Stop 60-second cycles
- Use 20-minute (1200 seconds) baseline for all future hibernations
- Document correct hibernation protocol

### Validation

- [x] Issue logged
- [ ] Next hibernation cycle uses 1200 seconds (20 minutes)
- [ ] Update behavioral learning to clarify "20 minutes minimum for autonomous sleepy mode"
- [ ] Verify no more rapid polling

### Lessons Learned

1. **Read the full documentation:** Sleepy mode has specific timing requirements different from general polling guidelines
2. **Context-specific rules:** Behavioral learnings apply generally, but agent-specific protocols (like sleepy.md 20-minute baseline) take precedence
3. **Resource conservation:** 60-second polls waste resources and violate sleepy mode's core principle of "aggressive hibernation"
4. **Self-improvement required:** Update AGENTS.md behavioral learning to clarify sleepy mode exception

### Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Update AGENTS.md POLLING entry to add: "Exception: Sleepy mode uses 20-minute baseline per sleepy.md protocol"
- [ ] Continue Group 0 monitoring with correct 20-minute cycles
- [ ] Test if user feels hibernation is appropriately patient
