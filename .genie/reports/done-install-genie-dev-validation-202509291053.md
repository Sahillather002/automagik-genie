# Genie Installation Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-09-29 10:53 UTC
**Branch:** genie-dev
**Scope:** Installation status verification before feature development

---

## ✅ Validation Summary

Genie framework installation is **complete and operational**. All core components are in place, properly configured, and functioning as expected.

---

## Components Verified

### 1. Product Documentation (✅ Complete)

All required product documents exist and are fully populated with genie-dev context:

- `.genie/product/mission.md` — Self-development meta-agent mission defined
- `.genie/product/mission-lite.md` — Elevator pitch present
- `.genie/product/tech-stack.md` — Node.js/TypeScript/pnpm stack documented
- `.genie/product/roadmap.md` — Phase 0-4 roadmap with Phase 1 in progress
- `.genie/product/environment.md` — Environment configuration documented

**Evidence:**
- Mission defines Genie Dev as meta-orchestration branch for self-improvement
- Tech stack confirms Node.js 20.x, TypeScript 5.9, ink CLI framework
- Roadmap shows Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 (Instrumentation & Telemetry) in progress

### 2. Agent Stack (✅ Complete)

Core workflow agents operational under `.genie/agents/`:

**Root Agents (4):**
- `plan.md` — Unified planning orchestrator
- `wish.md` — Wish document creation
- `forge.md` — Task breakdown and execution
- `review.md` — Validation and QA

**Specialists (9):**
- `bug-reporter`, `genie-qa`, `git-workflow`, `implementor`, `polish`, `project-manager`, `qa`, `self-learn`, `tests`

**Utilities (16):**
- `analyze`, `challenge`, `codereview`, `commit`, `consensus`, `debug`, `docgen`, `identity-check`, `install`, `prompt`, `refactor`, `secaudit`, `testgen`, `thinkdeep`, `tracer`, `twin`

**Evidence:**
- `./genie list agents` returns 29 agents across 3 folders
- Agent catalog renders correctly with descriptions

### 3. CLI Functionality (✅ Operational)

Genie CLI is executable and responsive:

- `./genie --help` — Renders full command palette
- `./genie list agents` — Shows 29 agents organized by folder
- `./genie list sessions` — Returns 0 active, 10 recent sessions
- CLI commands properly structured with `run`, `resume`, `view`, `stop`, `list`

**Evidence:**
- Help output displays Plan → Wish → Forge → Review workflow
- Session management operational (no active sessions, history visible)
- CLI executable bit set (`test -x ./genie` passes)

### 4. Supporting Infrastructure (✅ Present)

**Standards:**
- `.genie/standards/` contains `best-practices.md`, `code-style.md`, `naming.md`, `tech-stack.md`
- Code style guidance present

**State Management:**
- `.genie/state/agents/` exists for session tracking
- Logs and session data properly organized

**Additional Directories:**
- `.genie/guides/` — Onboarding documentation
- `.genie/instructions/` — Legacy Agent OS playbooks retained
- `.genie/knowledge/` — Knowledge base
- `.genie/reports/` — Done reports storage
- `.genie/wishes/` — Active wish contracts
- `.genie/tmp/` — Temporary workspace

### 5. Repository Health (✅ Good)

- `package.json` — Present (Node.js project configured)
- `README.md` — Present (documentation exists)
- `.genie/product/environment.md` — Environment config documented
- Git repository initialized and operational

---

## Verification Checklist (from install.md)

- [x] `.genie/product/` contains mission, mission-lite, tech-stack, roadmap, environment
- [x] Roadmap reflects reality (Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 in progress)
- [x] Tech stack matches detected dependencies and deployment
- [x] Environment variables documented and scoped
- [x] `./genie --help` renders and example invocations work
- [x] 29 agents properly organized in root, specialists, utilities folders
- [x] CLI session management functional
- [x] Standards and state directories present

---

## Installation Mode Used

**Mode 3: Hybrid Analysis** (codebase analysis + contextual validation)

- Detected existing `.genie/` structure with populated product docs
- Verified agent stack completeness (29 agents across 3 categories)
- Confirmed CLI wiring functional via help and list commands
- Validated state management infrastructure present

---

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Project state correctly detected
✅ All product documentation populated (no `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values)
✅ Generated documentation coherent and actionable
✅ Environment configuration matches technical requirements
✅ Framework fully functional with genie-dev context
✅ CLI commands operational (run, list, resume, view, stop)
✅ Agent catalog complete with 29 agents

## Configuration Summary

**Project:** Genie Dev (meta-agent self-improvement branch)
**Domain:** Framework development / self-orchestration
**Primary Stack:** Node.js 20.x, TypeScript 5.9, pnpm, ink CLI
**Agent Count:** 29 (4 root + 9 specialists + 16 utilities)
**Phase Status:** Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 in progress
**Branch Strategy:** genie-dev for experiments, main for stable releases

---

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Proceed with feature work** — Installation validated, ready for development
2. **Use workflow:** `/plan` → `/wish` → `/forge` → `/review` for any new work
3. **Run smoke tests:** `pnpm run build:genie && pnpm run test:genie` before major changes
4. **Session management:** Use `./genie list sessions` to track background work
5. **Evidence capture:** Store all done reports in `.genie/reports/`

---

## Risks & Constraints

**None detected.** Installation is complete and operational.

**Constraints:**
- Phase 1 roadmap item: Evidence Checklist must gate other instrumentation work
- Self-improvement changes require twin audits before merging to main
- Behavioral learnings (2 entries logged in CLAUDE.md) must be enforced

---

## Handoff

Installation validation complete. Ready to proceed with feature development using Plan → Wish → Forge → Review workflow.

**To start work:**
```bash
./genie run plan "[Discovery] Load @.genie/product/mission.md and @.genie/product/roadmap.md. [Implementation] Evaluate feature '<name>' and prepare wish brief. [Verification] Provide wish-readiness checklist."
```
