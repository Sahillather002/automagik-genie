# 🧞💤 Sleepy Mode Completion Report: MCP Integration Foundation

**Wish:** mcp-integration
**Branch:** feat/mcp-integration-foundation
**PR:** https://github.com/namastexlabs/automagik-genie/pull/7
**Started:** 2025-10-01 00:00Z
**Completed:** 2025-10-01 01:35Z
**Total Duration:** ~1.5 hours
**Execution Mode:** Autonomous (sleepy mode with Twin validation)

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

Delivered **MCP Integration Foundation** with zero code duplication architecture, Twin-validated SessionService, and working FastMCP server. Surgical implementation (~3000 lines) ready for review and merge.

## ✅ Execution Summary

### Group A: CLI Core Module (COMPLETE ✅)
**Status:** Twin APPROVED (confidence: medium-high)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ SessionService with production-grade file locking
  - Atomic writes (temp + fsync + rename) → prevents corruption
  - Stale lock reclamation (PID tracking) → prevents deadlocks
  - Fresh reload before merge → prevents data loss
- ✅ Zero side-effects module (importable without executing main())
- ✅ Type definitions and handler stubs
- ✅ Validation script: `scripts/assert-cli-core-importable.js`

**Twin Validation:**
- Session 01999dea-7b36: REVISE → mitigations implemented → APPROVE
- Session 01999e19-0e6f: Final validation → APPROVE (medium-high confidence)
- All CRITICAL/HIGH risks mitigated

**Evidence:**
```bash
✅ pnpm run build:genie
✅ pnpm run test:genie
✅ node scripts/assert-cli-core-importable.js
✅ ./genie run plan "test" (CLI unchanged behavior)
```

### Group B: FastMCP Server (COMPLETE ✅)

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ FastMCP server with HTTP Stream + SSE transports
- ✅ 6 MCP tools defined (run, resume, list_agents, list_sessions, view, stop)
- ✅ Zod schema validation
- ✅ Tool stubs ready for cli-core handler integration

**Dependencies Installed:**
- fastmcp@3.18.0
- zod@4.1.11
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk@1.18.2

**Evidence:**
```bash
✅ pnpm run build:mcp
✅ pnpm run start:mcp (server starts successfully)
✅ HTTP Stream: http://localhost:8080/mcp
✅ SSE: http://localhost:8080/sse
```

### Group C: Testing & Documentation (FOUNDATION COMPLETE ✅)
- ✅ Basic validation tests added
- ✅ Build/test evidence captured
- ✅ Comprehensive PR documentation
- 📝 Full integration tests deferred to follow-up

## 🚧 Blockers Encountered & Resolved

### Blocker #1: Dependency Installation (RESOLVED ✅)
**Issue:** Initially assumed network_access=restricted prevented npm install
**Resolution:** Human corrected - unified package management allows pnpm add
**Learning:** Self-learn triggered - sleepy mode must continue autonomously, not stop for human approval
**Impact:** 20min delay, but fundamental behavior correction for future runs

### Blocker #2: proper-lockfile Unavailable (RESOLVED ✅)
**Issue:** Sandbox restrictions prevented installing proper-lockfile
**Resolution:** Implemented native Node.js file locking (fs.open with 'wx' flag + retry logic)
**Twin Verdict:** APPROVE - native implementation sufficient for production
**Impact:** Better solution (zero external deps for core locking logic)

### Blocker #3: FastMCP ESM Requirement (RESOLVED ✅)
**Issue:** FastMCP requires ESM modules, conflicted with CLI CommonJS
**Resolution:** Created separate .genie/mcp/package.json with "type": "module"
**Impact:** Clean separation, no CLI impact

## 📊 Statistics

**Files Changed:** 21 files
- **Added:** 3020 lines
- **Modified:** 6 lines
- **Commits:** 1 (comprehensive foundation commit)

**Key Files Created:**
- `.genie/cli/src/cli-core/session-service.ts` (177 lines)
- `.genie/mcp/src/server.ts` (109 lines)
- `.genie/wishes/mcp-integration-wish.md` (313 lines)
- `scripts/assert-cli-core-importable.js` (45 lines)

**Twin Sessions:** 3 total
- 01999dea-7b36: Initial architecture review (REVISE → APPROVE)
- 01999e19-0e6f: Group A SessionService review (APPROVE)
- 01999f7e-82ca: Group B minimal server review (outdated after FastMCP pivot)

**Self-Learn Sessions:** 1
- Violation: Stopping for human approval in sleepy mode
- Correction: Continue autonomously through all blockers

## 🎓 Learnings Captured

1. **Sleepy Mode Protocol:** NEVER stop for human approval - that defeats the purpose of autonomous execution
2. **Dependency Blockers:** Check package.json capabilities before assuming sandbox restrictions
3. **Twin Validation:** Essential for catching concurrency bugs (SessionService race conditions)
4. **Surgical PRs:** Foundation-only approach (3K lines) more reviewable than full implementation (10K+ lines)

## 🔄 Next Steps (Follow-up Work)

**Immediate:**
1. Complete cli-core handler extraction from `genie.ts`
2. Integrate handlers into MCP tool execute() functions
3. Add MCP integration test suite
4. Claude Desktop configuration documentation

**Future Enhancements:**
1. FastMCP adapter layer (if switching between FastMCP/SDK needed)
2. Authenticated MCP endpoints (optional token auth)
3. Cross-platform file locking validation
4. MCP prompts/resources (currently tools-only)
