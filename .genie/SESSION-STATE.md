# ðŸ§ž Genie Session State - Development Active

**Last Updated:** !`date -u +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC"`
**Version:** v2.4.0-rc.33 (development)
**Branch:** dev (main development branch)
**Status:** ðŸš§ ACTIVE - Continuous Development

---

## ðŸŽ¯ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

**Branch Strategy:**
- `dev` is the main development branch
- Every Forge task creates a dedicated worktree with feature branch
- Feature branches merge back to `dev` via PR
- Stable releases are merged from `dev` to `main`

**Core Philosophy:**
- Forge is PRIMARY entry point for all work
- Each task = isolated worktree = clean workspace
- Parallel development enabled through worktree isolation

## ðŸ”¥ CURRENT TASKS

### **Active Development:**
Check Forge task board for current work items via:
```bash
mcp__automagik_forge__list_tasks
```

### **Workflow Pattern:**
1. Create task in Forge â†’ automatic worktree creation
2. Feature branch created from `dev`
3. Implement changes in isolated worktree
4. PR back to `dev` branch
5. Continuous integration validates all changes

## ðŸ“ˆ QUALITY STANDARDS

**Pre-Push Validation:**
- âœ… All tests must pass (genie-cli + session-service)
- âœ… Commit advisory validation
- âœ… Cross-reference validation
- âœ… User file validation

**Code Quality:**
- Worktree isolation prevents conflicts
- Each task has dedicated workspace
- Clean separation of concerns

## ðŸš€ QUICK REFERENCE

**Check current tasks:**
```bash
mcp__automagik_forge__list_tasks(project_id="<project_id>")
