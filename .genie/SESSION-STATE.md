# 🔄 Active Session State - 2025-10-17 20:30 UTC

**CRITICAL: Resume from this exact point**

## Current Work: CLAUDE.md Optimization

**Goal:** Eliminate AGENTS.md @ reference, consolidate into super-powerful CLAUDE.md

**Status:** IN PROGRESS - Delegated to implementor, awaiting results

---

## Active Neurons (Background)

### 1. Implementor Session: e96e1ffb-b5f0-4aa0-9557-10de4fcd54dd
**Task:** Extract 4 sections from AGENTS.md
- §Agent Configuration Standards (line ~240)
- §Git & GitHub Workflow Integration (line ~68)
- §Experimentation Protocol (line ~152)
- §Slash Command Reference (MISSING - doesn't exist)

**Status:** Running in background
**Next:** Check output with `mcp__genie__view with sessionId="e96e1ffb-b5f0-4aa0-9557-10de4fcd54dd"`

### 2. Learn Session: 84e3290d-9291-4a89-8d63-a1bcf14d7b47
**Task:** Documenting meta-learnings
- Minimal Effort, Maximum Value philosophy
- Discovery-First Collaborative Workflow
- Delegation Discipline (with my violation documented)

**Status:** Running
**Context:** Captured 7 critical learnings from Felipe

## TODO List (Active)

1. ✅ Prompt agent moved from neurons/ to workflows/
2. ✅ Updated migrate.ts references
3. ✅ Analysis complete: AGENTS.md is 85% waste (1374 lines, only 4 sections used)
4. 🔄 **CURRENT:** Wait for implementor extraction
5. ⏳ Review extracted sections for completeness
6. ⏳ Scan AGENTS.md for unreferenced critical content
7. ⏳ Inline sections into CLAUDE.md
8. ⏳ Verify ZERO instruction loss
9. ⏳ Remove @AGENTS.md reference
10. ⏳ Audit .claude/README.md (430 lines) for overlap
11. ⏳ Consolidate/eliminate README.md
12. ⏳ Final verification

---

## Key Findings

**Token Savings Potential:**
- Current: CLAUDE.md loads ~2000 lines via @ includes
- AGENTS.md: 1374 lines (only 4 sections needed = ~200 lines)
- Estimated savings: 1000-1200 lines

**Issues Found:**
1. CLAUDE.md line 152 references "§Slash Command Reference" - DOESN'T EXIST in AGENTS.md
2. .claude/README.md (430 lines) - unknown overlap, needs audit

---

## Open Questions for Felipe

1. **Slash Command Reference**: Remove broken reference from CLAUDE.md?
2. **.claude/README.md**: Eliminate entirely, consolidate, or keep?
3. **Inline approach**: Put extracted sections where `See @AGENTS.md §X` currently is?
4. **AGENTS.md fate**: Delete after extraction, or keep for templates?

---

## Meta-Learning Applied

**Failure documented:**
- I violated delegation discipline 10min after teaching it
- Burned 20K tokens reading AGENTS.md directly
- Felipe caught me: "this is your survivability"
- **Corrected:** Delegated to implementor, preserved context

**Pattern learned:**
> "Learning = Knowing + Applying. Context is life. Delegate or die."

## Resume Command

```bash
# Check implementor results
mcp__genie__view with sessionId="e96e1ffb-b5f0-4aa0-9557-10de4fcd54dd"

# If complete, mark TODO #4 done, move to #5
# If incomplete, resume implementor with feedback
```

**Context Health:** 35.7K tokens remaining (18%)
**Last Update:** 2025-10-17 20:30 UTC
**Session Continuity:** ACTIVE - Can resume from this exact state
