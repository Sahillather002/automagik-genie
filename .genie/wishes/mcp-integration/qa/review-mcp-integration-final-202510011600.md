# Wish Review – MCP Integration (EVIDENCE-BASED FINAL)

**Date:** 2025-10-01T16:00:00Z | **Status in wish:** FOUNDATION_COMPLETE
**Completion Score:** 59/100 (59%)

---

## Executive Summary

This is an **evidence-based** final review correcting inflated scores from previous reviews. The MCP integration delivers a foundation (59/100), not production-ready code. Critical gaps identified:

1. **Build broken:** Both CLI and MCP have TypeScript compilation errors (17+ errors)
2. **Tests non-functional:** Only 2/6 tools tested; 4/6 are stubs (schema-only validation)
3. **Evidence missing:** 0/6 MCP Inspector screenshots captured, 0 performance benchmarks
4. **Workaround implementation:** Shell-out pattern functional but not production-grade

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (BLOCK MERGE)
1. **Fix build errors (2-4 hours)**
   - Add @types/node to .genie/cli dependencies
   - Fix FastMCP type compatibility issues
   - Ensure both `pnpm run build:genie` and `pnpm run build:mcp` pass
2. **Complete test coverage (1-2 hours)**
   - Test run/resume/view/stop execution (not just schemas)
   - Add handler unit tests
3. **Capture evidence (1 hour)**
   - 6 MCP Inspector screenshots
   - Performance benchmarks for list operations

**Estimated effort to MVP (70/100):** 4-7 hours
**Estimated effort to production (80/100):** 8-10 hours

### Long-Term Improvements (v0.2.0)
4. **Handler integration refactor (4-8 hours)**
   - Implement Option 2 (data/view separation)
   - Remove shell-out workaround
   - Achieve production architecture
5. **Cross-platform validation (2-4 hours)**
   - Windows file locking tests
   - macOS SessionService validation
6. **Performance optimization (1-2 hours)**
   - Validate <500ms for list operations
   - Document latency benchmarks

**Estimated effort to 100/100:** 20-28 hours total

## Verification Commands

### Failed Commands (Blockers)
```bash
# Build validation (FAIL)
$ pnpm run build:genie
❌ 17+ TypeScript errors (missing @types/node, type mismatches)

$ pnpm run build:mcp
❌ FastMCP type errors (using constraints not supported by TS version)

# Cannot run validation without successful build
```

### Successful Commands (Limited)
```bash
# Automated tests (PARTIAL)
$ node tests/mcp-automated.test.js
✅ 30/30 assertions (but only 2/6 tools actually executed)

# Artifacts exist (OLD BUILD)
$ ls .genie/mcp/dist/server.js
✅ Exists (from previous build before type errors)
```

---

## Verdict

**Score: 59/100 (59%)**

**Status:** ❌ **NEEDS WORK (<70)**

**Breakdown:**
- ✅ Discovery: 30/30 (EXCELLENT)
- ⚠️ Implementation: 22/40 (NEEDS WORK) - workaround architecture, missing tests, build broken
- ❌ Verification: 7/30 (INCOMPLETE) - build blocker, 4/6 tools untested, no screenshots

**Assessment:** Foundation complete but not production-ready. Build must be fixed before merge.

---

## Critical Findings

### 🚫 MERGE BLOCKERS
1. **Build failures:** Cannot compile CLI or MCP server
2. **Test coverage gaps:** 4/6 tools never executed in tests
3. **Evidence missing:** 0/6 screenshots, 0 performance benchmarks

### ⚠️ WARNING SIGNS
4. **Previous reviews inflated:** Claimed 85-100/100 without evidence validation
5. **Status log inaccurate:** Group C claimed complete when build broken
6. **Workaround accepted:** Shell-out pattern not production architecture

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Build & Merge MVP (Recommended)
1. Fix TypeScript errors (add @types/node, fix type compatibility) - 2-4 hours
2. Verify build passes: `pnpm run build:genie && pnpm run build:mcp`
3. Re-run tests: `node tests/mcp-automated.test.js`
4. Update wish score to 59/100 (foundation-only)
5. Merge with "MCP MVP - foundation only" label
6. Create v0.2.0 wish for production completion

**Outcome:** MVP functional (59/100), blockers cleared, honest assessment

### Option 2: Pursue Production-Ready (80/100)
1. Fix build errors (2-4 hours)
2. Complete test coverage for all 6 tools (1-2 hours)
3. Capture 6 MCP Inspector screenshots (1 hour)
4. Document performance benchmarks (1 hour)
5. Update wish score to ~75/100
6. Merge as "MCP Integration - production-ready"

**Outcome:** Production-ready (75-80/100), all evidence requirements met

### Option 3: Full 100/100 (Not Recommended Now)
Include handler integration refactor + cross-platform validation (20-28 hours total).

**Recommendation:** Choose Option 1 (fix build, merge as MVP), pursue Option 2 in follow-up wish.
