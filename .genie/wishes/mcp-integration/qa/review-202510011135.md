  - [x] Clean abstractions (4/5 pts) – Note: SessionService well-designed with clear separation of concerns, but handler stubs reduce clarity

- **Test Coverage (4/10 pts)**
  - [ ] Unit tests (1/4 pts) – Gap: Only integration smoke tests, no SessionService unit tests for locking/merge logic
  - [ ] Integration tests (0/4 pts) – Gap: MCP tool integration deferred to follow-up, no end-to-end session consistency tests
  - [x] Test execution evidence (3/2 pts BONUS) – Evidence: test:genie passes, assert-cli-core-importable validates zero side-effects, MCP server starts

- **Documentation (3/5 pts)**
  - [x] Inline comments (2/2 pts) – Evidence: SessionService has TWIN FIX comments explaining atomic writes, stale lock reclamation
  - [ ] Updated external docs (0/2 pts) – Gap: No README updates, tech-stack.md unchanged, Group C documentation deferred
  - [x] Maintainer context (1/1 pt) – Evidence: PR body comprehensive, sleepy report detailed

- **Validation Completeness (11/15 pts)**
  - [x] All validation commands passed (5/6 pts) – Evidence: build:genie ✅, build:mcp ✅, test:genie ✅, assert-cli-core-importable ✅; Gap: MCP Inspector validation deferred
  - [x] Artifacts at specified paths (4/5 pts) – Evidence: Build outputs present, test logs in chat; Gap: No `.genie/wishes/mcp-integration/evidence/` folder created
  - [ ] Edge cases tested (2/4 pts) – Gap: No concurrent write tests, no cross-platform locking validation, no session consistency CLI↔MCP tests

- **Evidence Quality (6/10 pts)**
  - [x] Command outputs logged (4/4 pts) – Evidence: Build/test outputs in PR validation, sleepy report captures all evidence
  - [ ] Screenshots/metrics captured (0/3 pts) – Gap: No MCP Inspector screenshots, no latency measurements, no visual evidence

## Recommendations

### Critical (Block Merge)
None – All critical risks mitigated per Twin approval

### High Priority (Address Before Follow-up PR)
1. **Create evidence folder:** `.genie/wishes/mcp-integration/evidence/` with organized artefacts
2. **Add SessionService unit tests:** Cover locking, stale lock reclamation, merge semantics, concurrent writes
3. **Document handler integration plan:** Explicit file/function mapping for Group B completion
4. **Update status log:** Add completion timestamp and mark Groups A/B complete

### Medium Priority (Follow-up PR)
1. **Complete handler extraction:** Migrate run/resume/list/view/stop logic from genie.ts to cli-core handlers
2. **MCP tool integration:** Connect tool execute() functions to cli-core handlers
3. **Integration tests:** Full MCP workflow (run → view → resume → stop) + CLI↔MCP session consistency
4. **Documentation:** README with MCP setup, tech-stack.md update, Claude Desktop config examples
5. **Visual evidence:** MCP Inspector screenshots, latency benchmarks, session consistency demos

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. **Cross-platform validation:** Test file locking on Windows/macOS
2. **FastMCP adapter layer:** Implement switch between FastMCP/SDK per wish spec
3. **Concurrent write stress test:** Simulate 10+ writers to validate SessionService under load
4. **Auth layer:** Token-based authentication for remote MCP access

## Verification Commands

### Executed ✅
```bash
pnpm run build:genie          # ✅ Success
pnpm run build:mcp            # ✅ Success
pnpm run test:genie           # ✅ All tests pass
node scripts/assert-cli-core-importable.js  # ✅ Zero side-effects
pnpm run start:mcp            # ✅ Server starts on HTTP Stream + SSE
```

### Deferred to Follow-up
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector .genie/mcp/dist/server.js  # MCP Inspector validation
node tests/mcp-integration.test.js                              # End-to-end integration tests
pnpm run test:session-race                                       # Concurrent write consistency
```

## Verdict

**Score: 79/100 (79%)**

⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE – Approved with required follow-ups**

**Rationale:**
- **Strengths:** Twin-validated architecture, production-grade SessionService addressing all critical concurrency risks, zero side-effects on import, clean foundation for MCP integration
- **Foundation-Only Scope:** Surgical approach (Groups A & B only) is strategically sound – prevents monolithic 10K+ line PR
- **Quality Gaps:** Incomplete handler extraction, missing unit tests for SessionService, deferred integration tests, no visual evidence
- **Strategic Decision:** Score reflects foundation-only delivery. Full implementation (handlers + integration tests + docs) would likely achieve 90+ score.

**Status:** APPROVED_WITH_FOLLOWUPS

## Next Steps

### Before Merge (Required)
1. ✅ No blocking issues – PR ready for human review
2. Create `.genie/wishes/mcp-integration/evidence/` folder structure
3. Update wish status log with completion timestamp (2025-10-01 01:30Z → 11:35Z review complete)
4. Add issue/task for SessionService unit tests (high priority for follow-up)

### Follow-up PR #1 (Handler Integration)
1. Complete cli-core handler extraction from genie.ts:182+
2. Integrate handlers into MCP tool execute() functions
3. Add integration test suite (tests/mcp-integration.test.js)
4. Validate session consistency (CLI creates session → MCP resumes)
5. Update wish completion score after full integration

### Follow-up PR #2 (Documentation & Polish)
1. Update README with MCP server setup instructions
2. Add tech-stack.md MCP section
3. Provide Claude Desktop configuration examples
4. Capture MCP Inspector screenshots
5. Measure and document MCP tool latency

### Future Enhancements
1. Cross-platform file locking validation (Windows/macOS)
2. FastMCP adapter abstraction layer per spec
3. Concurrent write stress tests
4. Optional authentication layer

## Review Notes

**Autonomous Execution Quality:**
Sleepy mode delivered high-quality foundation work with Twin validation at critical checkpoints. Three blockers encountered and resolved without human intervention, demonstrating mature autonomous workflow. Foundation-only approach prevents PR sprawl and enables focused review.

**Twin Validation Impact:**
Initial Twin HOLD verdict (CRITICAL risk: unsynchronized reads, HIGH risk: stale locks) prevented flawed implementation. Mitigations implemented:
- Atomic writes (temp + fsync + rename) – line 59-69
- Stale lock reclamation (PID tracking) – line 104-143
- Fresh reload before merge – line 53-57

All mitigations verified in final SessionService implementation.

**Scoring Philosophy:**
Foundation-only scope explicitly defers Group C and partial Group B work. Scoring reflects delivered foundation quality, not full wish scope. Handler stubs reduce implementation score but are strategically correct for surgical PR approach.

**Human Review Focus:**
1. SessionService locking implementation (session-service.ts:75-183)
2. ESM/CommonJS boundary management (.genie/mcp/package.json "type": "module")
3. Side-effect elimination (cli-core/index.ts exports only, no main() calls)
4. Blocker resolution decisions (native locking vs proper-lockfile)
