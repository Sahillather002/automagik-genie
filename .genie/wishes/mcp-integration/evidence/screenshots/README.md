# MCP Visual Evidence

**Note:** MCP Inspector GUI not available in this environment. Providing equivalent CLI-based evidence with full command outputs and JSON-RPC message captures.

## Evidence Index

1. **tools-list.txt** - All 6 tools shown with schemas
2. **tool-schema-run.json** - Detailed schema for run tool
3. **list-agents-execution.txt** - list_agents tool execution with output
4. **list-sessions-execution.txt** - list_sessions tool execution with output
5. **run-execution.txt** - run tool execution creating a session
6. **prompts-list.txt** - All 4 prompts available

## Rationale

MCP Inspector is a graphical tool that connects to MCP servers via JSON-RPC. In CLI environments without GUI access, we provide equivalent evidence by:

1. Capturing raw JSON-RPC messages and responses
2. Documenting tool schemas and execution results
3. Verifying all protocol features (tools, prompts, initialization)

This approach provides the same validation as GUI screenshots - proving that:
- All 6 tools are discoverable
- Tool schemas are valid
- Tools execute successfully
- Prompts are available
- Server is stable

## How to Reproduce

```bash
# Start MCP server
node .genie/mcp/dist/server.js

# Send JSON-RPC requests via stdio:
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0"}}}' | node .genie/mcp/dist/server.js

echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}' | node .genie/mcp/dist/server.js

# Or use automated test:
node tests/mcp-automated.test.js
```

## Validation Status

✅ All 6 tools documented with schemas
✅ Tool execution results captured
✅ Prompts feature validated
✅ Protocol compliance confirmed

**Alternative:** If MCP Inspector becomes available, re-run with:
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node .genie/mcp/dist/server.js
```
