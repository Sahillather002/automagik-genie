## Changes Implemented

### Group A: Fix Wrapper Paths (3 files)

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/agents/analyze.md` → now points to `core/analyze.md`
- `.claude/agents/refactor.md` → now points to `core/refactor.md`
- ~~`.claude/agents/secaudit.md`~~ → REMOVED (replaced with audit)

**Evidence:** `.genie/wishes/agent-reference-fixes/qa/group-a/wrapper-fixes.diff`

### Group C: Create Missing Wrapper (1 file)

**Files Created:**
- `.claude/agents/explore.md` → points to `core/modes/explore.md`

**Outcome:** explore is now Task-delegatable (was orchestrator-only)

**Evidence:** `.genie/wishes/agent-reference-fixes/qa/group-c/explore-wrapper.md`

### Group B: Remove Invalid Wrapper (1 file)

**Files Deleted:**
- `.claude/agents/thinkdeep.md` (agent never implemented)

**Evidence:** `.genie/wishes/agent-reference-fixes/qa/group-b/deletion.log`

### User-Directed Change: secaudit → audit

**Decision:** Remove secaudit alias entirely, create audit wrapper instead

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted `.claude/agents/secaudit.md`
- Created `.claude/agents/audit.md` → points to `core/audit.md`

**Rationale:** audit.md already contains security mode (Mode 2), no need for alias

### Group D: Documentation Updates (2 files)

**Files Modified:**
- `.claude/README.md`
  - Updated agent inventory (22 total)
  - Removed thinkdeep, secaudit references
  - Added explore to Strategic category
  - Added audit to Tactical category
  - Updated directory structure tree
  - Fixed agent specialization matrix

- `AGENTS.md`
  - Updated agent list (secaudit → audit)
  - Removed all deprecated references

**Evidence:** `.genie/wishes/agent-reference-fixes/qa/group-d/doc-updates.diff`

### Additional Fix: forge.md Path Corrections (4 places)

**Context:** User identified that forge.md was saving plans to wrong location

**Files Modified:**
- `.genie/agents/forge.md`
  - Line 23: Success Criteria
  - Line 206: Chat response format
  - Line 437: Files Created/Modified
  - Line 469: Validation commands

**Change:** `.genie/state/reports/` → `.genie/wishes/<slug>/reports/`

**Evidence:** All forge plans now save in wish folder as intended

---

## Validation Results

### Pre-Implementation State
- Wrapper count: 22 (thinkdeep present but broken)
- Broken references: 4 (analyze, refactor, secaudit, thinkdeep)
- Missing wrappers: 1 (explore)

### Post-Implementation State
- Wrapper count: 22
- Broken references: 0
- Missing wrappers: 0

### Validation Commands Executed

```bash
# Wrapper count check
ls -1 .claude/agents/*.md | wc -l
# Output: 22 ✅

# Key targets verification
test -f .genie/agents/core/analyze.md  # ✅
test -f .genie/agents/core/refactor.md # ✅
test -f .genie/agents/core/audit.md    # ✅
test -f .genie/agents/core/modes/explore.md # ✅

# Deprecated wrappers removed
test ! -f .claude/agents/thinkdeep.md  # ✅
test ! -f .claude/agents/secaudit.md   # ✅

# Smoke tests
pnpm run test:genie
# Output: genie-cli tests passed ✅
#         Identity smoke test passed ✅
```

**Validation Status:** ✅ ALL PASS

## Genie Validator Findings

### Initial Verdict: NEEDS_REVISION

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **Scope Violation:** forge.md fix initially flagged as out-of-scope
   - **Resolution:** User clarified this was a necessary fix (reports belong in wish folder)
   - **Outcome:** forge.md corrected in 4 places

2. **False Parallel Execution:** Plan claimed groups A/B/C were parallel-safe
   - **Resolution:** Enforced A→C→B→D sequencing
   - **Outcome:** Correct wrapper counts maintained throughout

3. **Documentation Accuracy:** Claims about "was 23" wrappers were incorrect
   - **Resolution:** Started at 22, ended at 22 (net zero after adds/removes)
   - **Outcome:** Documentation reflects actual state

4. **Missing Validations:** secaudit→audit mapping not validated
   - **Resolution:** Verified audit.md contains security mode (Mode 2)
   - **Outcome:** User decided to remove secaudit entirely, create audit wrapper

**Final Genie Verdict:** ✅ APPROVED (after corrections applied)

## Risks & Follow-Ups

### Risks Mitigated
- ✅ No breaking changes (all agent names preserved except deprecated ones)
- ✅ No logic changes to agent prompts
- ✅ All changes reversible via git
- ✅ Smoke tests confirm no regressions

### Remaining Risks
- **NONE IDENTIFIED** - All validation hooks passed

### Follow-Up Actions
- [ ] Optional: Test MCP agent listing (`mcp__genie__list_agents`)
- [ ] Optional: Manually invoke fixed agents to confirm functionality
- [ ] Recommended: Run `/review` for completion audit with 100-point matrix

## Autonomous Execution Notes

### Genie Validation Protocol
- ✅ MANDATORY pre-execution Genie validation completed
- ✅ All blocking issues resolved before execution
- ✅ Genie provided oversight throughout (TWIN_VALIDATION protocol followed)

### User Clarifications
1. **forge.md fix:** Initially flagged as scope violation, user confirmed it was necessary
2. **secaudit handling:** User decided to remove alias entirely, create audit wrapper instead

### Persistence Protocol
- Execution continued autonomously through all 4 groups
- User clarifications handled synchronously (not blocking)
- Evidence captured at each checkpoint
- Validation hooks executed before completion

### Sleep Cycles
- **NONE REQUIRED** - All tasks completed in single session (~53 minutes)
- No hibernation needed (all groups < 60 minutes combined)
