## Discovery Summary
- **Primary analyst:** GENIE (autonomous planning mode)
- **Key observations:**
  - Genie CLI already has pluggable executor architecture perfect for MCP integration
  - Current code structure requires refactor to extract reusable command functions
  - FastMCP provides best-in-class TypeScript framework with minimal boilerplate
  - Session management via `.genie/state/agents/sessions.json` must remain unified
- **Assumptions (ASM-#):**
  - ASM-1: FastMCP framework provides cleanest TypeScript MCP implementation
  - ASM-2: Zero duplication means MCP tools invoke same CLI functions internally
  - ASM-3: MCP server exposes as remote server (HTTP streaming + SSE)
  - ASM-4: Session management remains unified across CLI and MCP
- **Open questions (Q-#):**
  - Q-1: Should MCP server support stdio transport? â†’ Yes, for local dev/testing
  - Q-2: How to handle agent metadata in MCP tools? â†’ Parse from frontmatter dynamically
  - Q-3: Should MCP server auto-start? â†’ Document manual + systemd, don't auto-configure
- **Risks:**
  - **RISK-1 (CRITICAL - Twin):** Command extraction side effects - `genie.ts:182` executes `main()` on import, handlers rely on in-file helpers â†’ **Mitigation:** Create `cli-core` module with pure handler factory functions
  - **RISK-2 (CRITICAL - Twin):** Session store collisions - `saveSessions` performs blind overwrite of `sessions.json` â†’ **Mitigation:** Implement `SessionService` with file locks/optimistic merge+retry
  - **RISK-3 (HIGH - Twin):** FastMCP built-in session features differ from Genie's store, may create parallel state â†’ **Mitigation:** Wrap FastMCP with adapter that forwards to shared CLI handlers, keep fallback to official SDK
  - RISK-4: MCP server lifecycle management â†’ mitigate with systemd service template
  - RISK-5: Auth needed for remote MCP â†’ mitigate with optional token auth

## Executive Summary
Expose Genie's agent orchestration capabilities as MCP tools, enabling Claude Desktop and other MCP clients to run, resume, list, view, and manage Genie agent sessions through the Model Context Protocol standard. Architecture reuses 100% of existing CLI logic with zero code duplication.

## Current State
- **What exists today:**
  - @.genie/cli/src/genie.ts: Full-featured CLI with run/resume/list/view/stop commands
  - @.genie/cli/src/executors/: Pluggable executor system (codex, claude)
  - @.genie/cli/src/session-store.ts: Unified session management
  - @.genie/cli/src/views/: Rich terminal UI rendering
- **Gaps/Pain points:**
  - No MCP protocol support â†’ can't integrate with Claude Desktop or other MCP clients
  - Command logic embedded in main CLI file â†’ not reusable without duplication
  - Manual CLI invocation only â†’ no programmatic API for external tools

## Target State & Guardrails
- **Desired behaviour:**
  - MCP server exposes 6 core tools matching CLI commands exactly
  - Claude Desktop users can run Genie agents via natural language
  - Session state remains consistent whether accessed via CLI or MCP
  - Background sessions work identically through both interfaces
  - Agent catalog dynamically reflects `.genie/agents/` directory
- **Non-negotiables:**
  - **Zero code duplication:** MCP tools must call shared CLI functions
  - **Unified session state:** Single source of truth in `.genie/state/`
  - **Behavioral equivalence:** MCP and CLI produce identical results
  - **Human approval gates:** No autonomous execution without checkpoints
  - **Evidence capture:** All changes documented with before/after validation

## Execution Groups

### Group A â€“ CLI Core Module (Zero Side-Effects Refactor)
- **Goal:** Create importable `cli-core` module with pure handler factories (addresses Twin RISK-1)
- **Surfaces:**
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/index.ts (new - factory exports)
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/run.ts (new)
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/resume.ts (new)
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/list.ts (new)
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/view.ts (new)
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/handlers/stop.ts (new)
  - @.genie/cli/src/cli-core/session-service.ts (new - addresses Twin RISK-2)
  - @.genie/cli/src/genie.ts (refactor to use cli-core)
- **Deliverables:**
  1. Create `SessionService` class with file lock/optimistic merge (RISK-2 mitigation)
  2. Extract handler logic into pure functions accepting `{ config, paths, sessionService, ... }`
  3. Export factory: `createHandlers({ config, paths })` returns `{ run, resume, list, view, stop }`
  4. Update `genie.ts` to call `createHandlers()` and use returned functions
  5. Ensure `cli-core` module can be imported WITHOUT executing CLI `main()`
  6. Preserve 100% behavioral equivalence
- **Evidence:**
  - `pnpm run build:genie` succeeds
  - `pnpm run test:genie` passes all tests
  - **NEW (Twin):** `node scripts/assert-cli-core-importable.js` confirms no side effects on import
  - Manual smoke: `./genie run plan "test"` unchanged behavior
  - Manual smoke: `./genie list sessions` unchanged
  - Git diff: extraction only, no logic changes
- **Suggested personas:** `implementor`
- **External tracker:** TBD

### Group B â€“ MCP Server with FastMCP Adapter
- **Goal:** Create MCP server with adapter layer for FastMCP (addresses Twin RISK-3)
- **Surfaces:**
  - @package.json (update dependencies)
  - @.genie/mcp/tsconfig.json (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/server.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/adapter/fastmcp-adapter.ts (new - Twin RISK-3 mitigation)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/adapter/sdk-fallback.ts (new - official SDK alternative)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/tools/run.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/tools/resume.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/tools/list-agents.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/tools/list-sessions.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/tools/view.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/tools/stop.ts (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/src/utils/response-formatter.ts (new)
- **Deliverables:**
  1. Install: `pnpm add fastmcp zod @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
  2. Create `.genie/mcp/tsconfig.json` extending CLI config
  3. Implement FastMCP adapter that imports `cli-core` and forwards ALL session state to shared `SessionService` (RISK-3 mitigation)
  4. Implement official SDK fallback adapter (same interface, no FastMCP dependency)
  5. Define 6 MCP tools with Zod schemas, calling `cli-core` handlers via adapter
  6. Add env var `GENIE_MCP_ADAPTER=fastmcp|sdk` to select adapter at runtime
  7. Add npm scripts: `"start:mcp": "node .genie/mcp/dist/server.js"`, `"build:mcp": "tsc -p .genie/mcp/tsconfig.json"`
- **Evidence:**
  - `pnpm run build:mcp` succeeds
  - Server starts with both adapters: `GENIE_MCP_ADAPTER=fastmcp pnpm run start:mcp` AND `GENIE_MCP_ADAPTER=sdk pnpm run start:mcp`
  - Health check: `curl http://localhost:8080/health` returns `ok`
  - **NEW (Twin):** Verify both adapters use shared `SessionService` (no parallel state)
  - MCP Inspector connects successfully
  - All 6 tools functional in both adapter modes
  - Session created via `genie_run` appears in `./genie list sessions`
- **Suggested personas:** `implementor`, `tests`
- **External tracker:** TBD

### Group C â€“ Integration Testing & Documentation
- **Goal:** Validate end-to-end MCP workflow and document deployment
- **Surfaces:**
  - @.genie/mcp/README.md (new)
  - @.genie/product/tech-stack.md (update)
  - @.genie/mcp/examples/claude-desktop-config.json (new)
  - @.genie/mcp/examples/systemd-service-template (new)
  - @tests/mcp-integration.test.js (new)
- **Deliverables:**
  1. Test full conversation flow via MCP Inspector:
     - `genie_run` â†’ creates session
     - `genie_view` â†’ shows transcript
     - `genie_resume` â†’ continues session
     - `genie_stop` â†’ terminates session
  2. Verify CLI and MCP session state consistency
  3. Test agent catalog dynamic loading from frontmatter
  4. Document MCP server setup (installation, configuration, deployment)
  5. Provide Claude Desktop configuration example
  6. Create systemd service template for production deployment
  7. Update tech stack documentation with MCP server section
  8. Write integration test suite covering all 6 tools
- **Evidence:**
  - Claude Desktop connects and lists all Genie tools
  - Full MCP conversation flow documented with screenshots
  - Session state verified: `./genie list sessions` shows MCP-created session
  - Resume from CLI works on MCP-created session
  - Integration tests: `node tests/mcp-integration.test.js` passes
  - Documentation reviewed and approved
- **Suggested personas:** `qa`, `polish`
- **External tracker:** TBD

## Verification Plan
- **Validation steps:**
  1. Build validation: `pnpm run build:genie && pnpm run build:mcp`
  2. CLI regression: `pnpm run test:genie` (all existing tests pass)
  3. **NEW (Twin):** `node scripts/assert-cli-core-importable.js` (no side effects on import)
  4. **NEW (Twin):** `pnpm run test:session-race` (concurrent CLI/MCP write consistency)
  5. MCP integration: `node tests/mcp-integration.test.js` (both adapters)
  6. Manual workflow: Claude Desktop â†’ run agent â†’ view â†’ resume â†’ stop
  7. Session consistency: verify CLI and MCP share same sessions.json
  8. Performance: measure MCP tool latency (<500ms for list operations)
  9. **NEW (Twin):** Paired HTTP-stream/SSE smoke test with latency logging
- **Evidence storage:** `.genie/wishes/mcp-integration/evidence/`
  - `cli-refactor-diff.patch` (Group A extraction changes)
  - `mcp-server-startup.log` (Group B server initialization)
