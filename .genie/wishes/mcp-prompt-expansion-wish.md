## Discovery Summary
- **Primary analyst:** GENIE (plan agent)
- **Key observations:**
  - Current: 4 workflow prompts (start-agent, debug-issue, plan-feature, review-code)
  - Vibe shift: **Analysis and reasoning over execution**
  - User priority: Simple naming (prompt not refine-prompt), complete core workflow (wish, forge)
  - Template value: Prompts that structure complex multi-phase thinking (twin has 17 modes!)
- **Assumptions (ASM-#):**
  - ASM-1: Simple, verb-based names improve discoverability (plan not plan-feature, review not review-code)
  - ASM-2: Prompts should help users *think through* problems before executing
  - ASM-3: 10 prompts total provides complete coverage without overwhelm
  - ASM-4: Focus on analysis/reasoning agents, skip simple execution helpers (tests, refactor, commit, security, docs)
- **Decisions (DEC-#):**
  - DEC-1: Clean up existing prompts: rename plan-feature→plan, review-code→review; remove start-agent, debug-issue
  - DEC-2: Add wish + forge to complete core plan→wish→forge→review workflow
  - DEC-3: Prioritize structured thinking templates (twin, consensus, debug, thinkdeep, analyze, prompt)
  - DEC-4: Skip execution helpers (implement, polish, tests, security, docs, commit, refactor) - too simple for templates
  - **DEC-5: Each prompt includes condensed prompting guidance from @.genie/agents/utilities/prompt.md** - every prompt becomes a teaching moment
- **Risks:**
  - RISK-1: Prompts become stale as agents evolve (Mitigation: Use @ references to agent files)
  - RISK-2: Template complexity may confuse new users (Mitigation: Clear examples in each prompt)

## Executive Summary
Refine MCP prompt library to 10 clean, focused templates with emphasis on **analysis and reasoning over execution**. Clean up existing workflow prompts (plan, review) by removing suffixes and redundant prompts (start-agent, debug-issue). Add 2 workflow prompts (wish, forge) to complete plan→wish→forge→review cycle. Add 6 structured thinking templates (twin, consensus, debug, thinkdeep, analyze, prompt) for systematic problem analysis before implementation.

## Current State
- **What exists today:**
  - @.genie/mcp/src/server.ts with 4 prompts (lines 325-674)
  - Prompts: start-agent, debug-issue, plan-feature, review-code
  - Pattern: Template generators that construct structured agent invocations
  - Focus: Getting started workflows
- **Gaps/Pain points:**
  - Core workflow incomplete: plan exists, but wish/forge missing as prompts
  - No structured thinking templates (twin's 17 modes, consensus framework, debug investigation)
  - No prompt engineering meta-helper (user's explicit request)
  - Analysis/reasoning workflows require manual agent discovery

## Target State & Guardrails
- **Desired behaviour:**
  - 10 prompts total: **Workflow (4)** + **Analysis/Reasoning (6)**
  - **Workflow prompts (4):**
    - plan (rename from plan-feature)
    - wish (new)
    - forge (new)
    - review (rename from review-code)
  - **Analysis/Reasoning prompts (6):**
    - twin, consensus, debug, thinkdeep, analyze, prompt (all new)
  - **Remove:** start-agent (not needed), debug-issue (duplicate)
  - Simple, verb-based naming (no -issue or -feature suffixes)
  - Each prompt: arguments, structured template output, example invocations
  - Prompts generate formatted agent run commands (like plan does)
- **Non-negotiables:**
  - Clean naming: plan not plan-feature, review not review-code
  - Follow existing template generator pattern in server.ts
  - **Each prompt includes condensed prompting guidance from @.genie/agents/utilities/prompt.md**
    - Discovery→Implementation→Verification pattern
    - @ references for context loading
    - Success criteria / Never Do sections
    - Concrete examples over descriptions
  - Focus on analysis/reasoning agents, skip simple execution helpers
  - Validation via MCP Inspector + Claude Desktop

## Genie Prompting Framework (@.genie/agents/utilities/prompt.md)

**1. Task Breakdown:**
<task_breakdown>
1. [Discovery] What to investigate
2. [Implementation] What to change
3. [Verification] What to validate
</task_breakdown>

**2. Auto-Context with @:**
@src/auth/middleware.ts auto-loads files (no manual "read X then Y")

**3. Success/Failure Boundaries:**
[SUCCESS CRITERIA] ✅ Tests pass ✅ No hardcoded paths
[NEVER DO] ❌ Skip coverage ❌ Commit secrets

**4. Concrete Examples:**
Show code: `try/catch` not "ensure error handling"

**5. Checklist:**
✅ Discovery→Implementation→Verification
✅ @ references for context
✅ Success criteria defined
✅ Concrete examples

**Example:**
[Discovery] Review @src/auth/middleware.ts, identify gaps
[Implementation] Add JWT refresh endpoint, update middleware
[Verification] Run npm run security-check, test flow
[SUCCESS CRITERIA] ✅ Tokens work ✅ Audit passes
[NEVER DO] ❌ Store in localStorage ❌ Log tokens

💡 This framework = maximum clarity + effectiveness
```

## Verification Plan

  1. Build MCP server: `cd .genie/mcp && pnpm build`
  2. Test with MCP Inspector: `npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/server.js`
  3. Verify all prompts listed in inspector UI
  4. Test each prompt with sample arguments
  5. Validate generated guidance includes workflow steps, examples, next actions
  6. Test in Claude Desktop (if configured)
- **Evidence storage:** `.genie/wishes/mcp-prompt-expansion/evidence/`
  - `inspector-screenshots/` - MCP Inspector UI showing prompts
  - `prompt-outputs/` - Generated guidance for each prompt
  - `validation-notes.md` - Manual testing observations
- **Branch strategy:** Existing branch `feat/mcp-integration-foundation` (user confirmed)

### Evidence Checklist
- **Validation commands (exact):**
  ```bash
  # Build
  cd .genie/mcp && pnpm build

  # Test with inspector
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/server.js

  # Verify compilation
  pnpm run check
  ```
- **Artefact paths (where evidence lives):**
  - Screenshots: `.genie/wishes/mcp-prompt-expansion/evidence/inspector-screenshots/*.png`
  - Outputs: `.genie/wishes/mcp-prompt-expansion/evidence/prompt-outputs/*.txt`
  - Notes: `.genie/wishes/mcp-prompt-expansion/evidence/validation-notes.md`
- **Approval checkpoints (human sign-off required before work starts):**
  1. Review prompt naming strategy (simple, action-oriented)
  2. Approve 8 vs 12 prompt scope decision
  3. Review generated guidance quality for 2 sample prompts
  4. Approve merge after validation complete
