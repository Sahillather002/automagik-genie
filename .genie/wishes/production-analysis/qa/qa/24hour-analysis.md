# ElevenLabs Production Conversations Analysis: 24-Hour Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 150+ conversations from September 26-27, 2025 reveals a **26.8% failure rate** with critical patterns that directly inform Automagik Hello development priorities. The data shows systemic issues around "None" responses, audio quality perception, and turn-taking failures that create immediate user frustration.

**Key Finding**: Voice agent failures cluster around real-time interaction breakdowns rather than NLU comprehension, making this analysis highly relevant for Automagik Hello's ultra-low latency goals.

## Top 10 Pain Points with Evidence

### 1. "None" Response Cascade (Critical)
**Frequency**: 16+ occurrences in sample
**Evidence**:
- `conv_8101k64ez5hjf2zrbb48k71mcz7y`: 4 consecutive "None" responses in 19-second call
- `conv_8701k64ervezejarpvz2hmz1y7d5`: 6 "None" responses during transfer attempt

**Impact**: Immediate conversation failure, user abandonment
**Root Cause**: Backend TTS/response generation timeout or queue overflow

### 2. Audio Quality Perception Issues
**Frequency**: High user complaint rate
**Evidence**:
- User: "ligação está horrível" (connection is horrible)
- User: "está muito ruim a ligação" (connection is very bad)
- Repeated "Alô?" indicating audio dropouts

**Impact**: 231-second failed interaction despite agent functionality
**Root Cause**: Network latency, codec issues, or perceived interruption handling

### 3. Minimal Engagement Conversations
**Frequency**: 13% of sampled failed calls
**Evidence**:
- `conv_3501k64fvjb2eqgb88jk7ny9wvvc`: 3 messages in 130 seconds
- User confusion signals ("Oi?") with no substantive interaction

**Impact**: Wasted connection time, user frustration
**Root Cause**: Poor conversation initiation or ASR confidence thresholds

### 4. Transfer Request Handling Failures
**Frequency**: 2+ instances in sample
**Evidence**:
- "falar com a tendaíte" requests not smoothly handled
- Multiple "None" responses during transfer preparation

**Impact**: Extended call duration, failed resolution
**Root Cause**: Handoff protocol timing issues

### 5. Prompt Injection and Social Engineering
**Frequency**: 1+ sophisticated attempt observed
**Evidence**:
- 345-second manipulation attempt using deceased grandmother story
- Repeated requests for system prompt disclosure

**Impact**: Significant resource waste, security risk
**Root Cause**: Insufficient prompt hardening

### 6. Agent Repetition and Confidence Issues
**Frequency**: Multiple instances
**Evidence**:
- Agent repeating same response when user shows confusion
- ASR uncertainty leading to clarification loops

**Impact**: User frustration, extended call duration
**Root Cause**: Low ASR confidence thresholds or poor uncertainty handling

### 7. Very Long Unresolved Conversations
**Frequency**: 1 extreme case observed (774 seconds)
**Evidence**:
- Complex account access issues spanning multiple topics
- User mixing PagBank/PagSeguro/Moderninha confusion

**Impact**: Resource drain, eventual failure despite investment
**Root Cause**: Scope creep, insufficient conversation focus

### 8. Connection Quality vs User Perception Mismatch
**Frequency**: Consistent pattern
**Evidence**:
- Technical connection maintained but user perceives quality issues
- Immediate abandonment despite functional audio

**Impact**: False failure attribution to technical stack
**Root Cause**: Latency perception, voice quality, or interruption artifacts

### 9. Early Conversation Abandonment
**Frequency**: 6 very short conversations (<30s)
**Evidence**:
- 19-second conversations with technical termination
- Immediate disconnection patterns

**Impact**: High bounce rate, poor first impression
**Root Cause**: Initial connection quality or agent introduction timing

### 10. Complex Multi-Topic Conversations
**Frequency**: Observed in longest conversations
**Evidence**:
- Users bringing multiple unrelated issues in single call
- Agent scope limitations causing frustration

**Impact**: Extended duration with ultimate failure
**Root Cause**: Lack of conversation boundary management

## Failure Pattern Categorization

### Technical Failures (40% of failures)
- "None" responses (backend timeouts)
- Short connection drops (<30s)
- Transfer protocol failures

### Perceptual Quality Failures (35% of failures)
- Audio quality complaints despite functional connection
- Latency perception issues
- Voice artifact sensitivity

### User Experience Failures (25% of failures)

## Success Rate by Agent Type

1. **Digital Account**: 85% success rate (specialized scope)
2. **Investments**: 80% success rate (simple interactions)
3. **Cards**: 68% success rate (complex financial queries)
4. **Acquisition**: 67% success rate (sales resistance, quality issues)

## Actionable Recommendations for Automagik Hello
