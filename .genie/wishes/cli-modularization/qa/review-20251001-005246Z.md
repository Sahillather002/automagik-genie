## Deductions & Gaps
None – all evaluation checkpoints satisfied with evidence.

## Recommendations
1. Maintain snapshot tooling for future CLI changes to guard behavior regressions.
2. Consider scheduling periodic perf baseline captures to monitor drift beyond this refactor.

## Verification Commands
- `cd .genie/cli && npm run build`
- `.genie/cli/snapshots/validate-against-baseline.sh .genie/cli/snapshots/baseline-20250930-195519`
- `.genie/cli/snapshots/validate-improved.sh`
- `./genie run qa/codex-parameter-test "Post-refactoring validation"`
- `./genie run qa/claude-parameter-test "Post-refactoring validation"`

## Verdict
**Score: 100/100 (100%)**
- ✅ **EXCELLENT** – Ready for merge

**Status:** APPROVED

## Next Steps
1. Keep the wish in COMPLETED state and reference this review when preparing the final commit/PR summary.
2. Monitor subsequent CLI changes against the established snapshot baseline; refresh baseline only when intentional behavior changes are introduced.
